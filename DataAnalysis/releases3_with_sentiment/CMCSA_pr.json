Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, \"We delivered strong operational and financial results in the fourth quarter, capping another great year for Comcast, including double-digit growth in full-year adjusted EPS, record free cash flow and 1.4 million broadband net additions in the U.S. Our teams at Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky continued to execute at a high level, strengthening our leadership position in our markets. Looking ahead, in 2020 we are leaning into exciting opportunities, including: further differentiating our broadband product in the U.S. through innovations like Flex and xFi Advanced Security; accelerating the deployment of Sky Q; launching a new broadband service in Italy; debuting Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan; and introducing a world-class streaming service - Peacock - which leverages capabilities from across Comcast.

        "content": "\nJeff Shell Named CEO of NBCUniversal, Effective January 2020\n    PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) today announced that NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke will retire on August 14, 2020, following the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Effective January 1, 2020, Jeff Shell will become CEO of NBCUniversal, reporting to Burke, who will move to the role of Chairman, NBCUniversal. Upon Burke\u2019s retirement, Shell will report directly to Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast.\n\n\u201cI cannot thank Steve enough for the incredible impact he has had on this entire company. I will miss Steve\u2019s trusted partnership, and I know I speak for both myself and my late father Ralph when I say that we will be forever grateful to him for shaping first Comcast and then NBCUniversal into the great companies they are today. When Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2011, I never imagined it would become the fastest growing media company. Steve\u2019s leadership and the team that he built has had everything to do with this outstanding performance,\u201d said Mr. Roberts.\n\nMr. Roberts continued, \u201cJeff Shell is the ideal executive to take the helm at NBCUniversal. He has a stellar track record across both the film and TV side of the business, as well as a wealth of international experience. I have worked closely with Jeff for many years and he is an extraordinary leader who inspires loyalty, delivers strong results and cares deeply about our company, its employees and partners. I could not be more confident in his ability to lead NBCUniversal into the future.\u201d\n\nMr. Burke commented, \u201cIt has been a privilege to work so closely with Brian for the last 22 years, and particularly to have had the opportunity to lead NBCUniversal for the last nine. This is a very special company and I am proud of the people I have worked with and the things we have accomplished together. While this has been a dream job, it has always been my plan to hand off the baton at the right moment and move on to the next chapter of my life where I can pursue a different set of interests. It is great to know I am leaving the company in terrific hands with Jeff, who is the right leader to usher in the next phase of growth and success for NBCUniversal.\u201d\n\nMr. Shell added, \u201cIt is truly an honor to step into this role, and I am excited that Brian and the Comcast board are giving me the incredible opportunity to help steer the future of NBCUniversal. I\u2019m sincerely grateful to Steve, who has been an amazing boss and mentor for the last 15 years and leaves behind an extraordinary legacy of visionary leadership and success. I look forward to building on this strong track record and partnering with the many talented leaders across the company.\u201d\n\nBurke has presided over NBCUniversal during a time of unprecedented growth and achievements for the company. Under his leadership, NBCUniversal increased its adjusted EBITDA from $3.4 billion to $8.6 billion since the Comcast acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2011 through 2018 \u2013 achieving the fastest annual growth rate of any major media company.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the most competitive content landscape in history, the television networks of NBCUniversal enjoyed record success. NBC ascended from fourth place to number one, winning the primetime season for six years in a row. The cable networks achieved record profit levels, with USA Network continuing its reign as the number one cable entertainment network. The news division reached new heights with all four NBC News programs ranking number one, while MSNBC enjoyed tremendous success as one of the fastest growing cable networks. Additionally, Telemundo eclipsed Univision as the number one Spanish-language network in primetime.\n\nThe film business also achieved new milestones, as Universal Pictures had a string of blockbusters that yielded two of the most profitable years in the studio\u2019s 107-year history, thanks to a successful franchise strategy and a key partnership with Illumination that spawned hits such as Fast & Furious, Jurassic World and Despicable Me.\n\nIn a strategic move to double the company\u2019s animated film output, Burke helped engineer the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, home to Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Boss Baby and countless other hits.\n\nThe company\u2019s success in animated film created new IP that became the basis from some of the most popular theme park attractions at Universal Parks and Resorts, which helped transform this business into one of NBCUniversal\u2019s biggest growth drivers. The Parks business also underwent a fruitful expansion, with the opening of the Volcano Bay water park in Orlando, the extraordinarily popular Harry Potter attractions, and five new hotels.\n\nUnder Burke\u2019s leadership, the company won the broadcast rights for the Olympics in a landmark deal that locked in the games for NBC Sports through 2032. Over the years, the Games have been the most-watched television events of the year \u2013 from London to Sochi to Rio \u2013 and have generated record profits.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Burke\u2019s tenure at the company was the collaborative culture he created. Burke designed a cross-company effort, nicknamed \u201cSymphony,\u201d where every NBCUniversal brand, in addition to Comcast, puts its promotional muscle behind a singular marketing priority. This initiative has yielded some of the biggest box office hits, TV series premieres and higher theme park attendance.\n\nPrior to running NBCUniversal, Burke served as Chief Operating Officer of Comcast, following 11 years as President of its cable division. There, he helped grow the company into the largest cable and internet provider and led the highly successful integration of AT&T Broadband with Comcast.\n\nBefore Comcast, Burke held several leadership roles at The Walt Disney Company, including as President of ABC Broadcasting, and President and Chief Operating Officer of Euro Disney S.A. Burke serves on the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nJeff Shell currently oversees the company\u2019s film and network television businesses including NBC Entertainment, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group (UFEG), Telemundo and NBCUniversal International. Prior to that, he served as Chairman of UFEG and led the film division to record profit crossing the $5 billion mark in global box office in both 2015 and 2017.\n\nPreviously, as Chairman of NBCUniversal International, Shell managed all aspects of NBCUniversal\u2019s international businesses including International TV Distribution, Global Television Networks and International Television Production. He also oversaw, in partnership with their domestic leaders, CNBC International, International Theatrical Marketing and Distribution, International Home Entertainment and International Theme Parks Operations.\n\nPrior to joining NBCUniversal, Shell served as President of Comcast Programming Group where he was responsible for managing Comcast\u2019s national and regional television networks including E! Entertainment Network, the Golf Channel, International Channel Networks, and Comcast Sports Group. Under his leadership, Comcast\u2019s networks grew significantly in distribution, viewership and profitability during his six-year tenure.\n\nAbout Comcast Corporation\n\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky.

The Xfinity Stream app, which allows customers to watch live TV and On Demand content on any device, is now available on the NuEyes e2 smartglasses and VR magnifying device that enhances the usable vision of a person who is visually impaired. Xfinity Stream is pre-installed on NuEyes e2, allowing users with visual disabilities to see TV shows, news, movies, live sports, and more, independently.\n\nFounded by a veteran, NuEyes\u2019 mission is to give millions of people across the U.S. who are visually impaired the independence they may have lost due to conditions like macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. The lightweight design of the NuEyes e2, paired with handsfree and wireless functionality, gives people with low vision the ability to participate in their everyday lives in ways that were once difficult or impossible, like clearly seeing loved ones\u2019 faces, reading, cooking and enjoying television.\n\n\u201cBeing blind since birth, I know firsthand the power of technology to enhance independence,\u201d said Tom Wlodkowski, Vice President of Accessibility at Comcast. \u201cOur partnership with NuEyes is an extension of our commitment to designing great entertainment experiences for people of all abilities.\u201d\n\nJames Baldwin, an 18-year Army Veteran, began losing his vision three years ago due to an injury sustained during his service. He lives with a prosthetic left eye and limited vision in his right eye. James was one of the first customers to experience Xfinity Stream on NuEyes e2, allowing him to watch TV again for the first time in years. You can watch James' story here, including James\u2019 reaction to seeing his wife Claudia, a fellow blind veteran, for the first time using NuEyes.\n\n\u201cCollaborating with Comcast has been an absolute joy,\u201d said Mark Greget, Founder and CEO of NuEyes. \u201cTo be able to stream content directly to our consumers\u2019 eyes in a way that has never been done before enables millions of visually impaired people to continue enjoying their TV experience and more.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Comcast launched the industry\u2019s first talking TV guide, introduced a voice-activated remote control, launched X1 eye control for the TV and produced the first live entertainment show in U.S. broadcast history, The Wiz Live, to be accessible to people with a visual disability.

        "content": "\nMilestone Marks Another Breakthrough in the Fight to Protect Consumers from Fraudulent Robocalls\n    PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nToday, U.S. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, and Canada\u2019s CRTC Chairman Ian Scott completed the first-of-their-kind end-to-end international authenticated calls using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol using Xfinity Voice and Telus wireless phone services. The milestone represents another breakthrough in the fight to protect consumers from fraudulent robocalls.\n\nCaller ID spoofing is a widespread problem that causes significant harm to American consumers. The FCC has cited predictions that, by the end of 2019, over 44 percent of all calls to mobile phones will be scam calls, and that nine out of 10 scam calls will be spoofed so that they appear to come from a familiar area code.\n\n\u201cComcast has been at the forefront of these efforts from day one, and will continue working diligently to eradicate the nuisance calls that have plagued consumers for years,\u201d said Tony Werner, President of Technology, Product and Xperience, Comcast Cable. \u201cWe applaud Chairman Pai and the FCC\u2019s leadership to protect consumers by working with voice providers like Xfinity to pave the way for broader implementation of STIR/SHAKEN and other robocall mitigation techniques.\u201d\n\nSTIR (Secure Telephony Identity Revisited) and SHAKEN (Secure Handling of Asserted information using toKENs) is a revolutionary emerging technology that enables voice providers to \u201csign\u201d and \u201cverify\u201d caller ID information, thus preventing bad actors from manipulating or \u201cspoofing\u201d caller ID information in an effort to deceive and defraud consumers.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s deployment has been implemented steadily for domestic calls. Comcast, for instance, announced in March of 2019 that it had completed the first exchange of authenticated calls under the STIR/SHAKEN protocol with AT&T, and announced in April that it had begun exchanging authenticated calls with T-Mobile.\n\nWhile these efforts are making a difference domestically, a large number of fraudulent spoofed robocalls originate from overseas, prompting a need for cross-border coordination on caller ID authentication. The groundbreaking, fully authenticated calls between Chairman Pai and Chairman Scott\u2014involving two voice providers from different countries\u2014illustrate that it is possible to extend the substantial benefits of STIR/SHAKEN to international calls and open a new front in consumer protection.\n\nFor more information about what Comcast is doing to fight robocalls, visit www.corporate.comcast.com.\n\nAbout Comcast\n\nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky.
