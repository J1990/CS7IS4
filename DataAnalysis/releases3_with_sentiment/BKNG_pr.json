        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Dec 10, 2019 12:03AM EST",
        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- According to new research by Agoda, one of the world's fastest growing digital travel platforms, the top reasons people travel are 'Nature or Scenery', 'Sun, Beaches or Islands', and 'Food & Dining'. Jeju Island, in Korea, has all of these to offer\u00a0-- so it's no surprise that it has become so popular. Indeed, with its mountains, beaches, and laid-back lifestyle, Jeju is beloved by both domestic and international travelers. It is the most popular Korean destination (after Seoul) for travelers from all over Asia-Pacific, as Agoda's booking data for the past two years reveals.What travelers may not know\u00a0is that Jeju is a year-round destination. During the summer, of course, Jeju's spectacular beaches draw travelers. But in winter, humidity is lower, skies are clear, and the air is cooler\u00a0-- so it's perfect for other kinds of activities, especially hiking in the mountains. And no matter what kind of activities attract travelers, nor whether\u00a0they are looking for a hotel, an apartment, a home, or a villa, the natural splendor of Jeju can be discovered\u00a0while staying at an Agoda-listed property.Let's start with Jeju's coastline, which offers an astonishingly diverse array of natural settings. Jusangjeolli Cliff, one of the island's most famous coastal destinations, can be found in the eastern Jungmun Tourist areas. At the nearby observatory, travelers can enjoy the breathtaking spectacle of waves crashing against huge stone pillar steps. Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, famous for its picturesque sunrises, offers a glimpse of the nearby mysterious coastal cliff. Whether\u00a0travelers want to climb to the top or prefer to enjoy the view of it from nearby beaches such as Gwangchigi Beach, it's worth seeing. Seopjikoji, well-known as a TV location spot for Korean dramas has a walking trail that offers magnificent coastal views, while Jeongbang Falls offers a unique view of the water falling directly into the sea.Hallasan, the tallest mountain in South Korea, is a prominent feature of the Jeju landscape. A dormant volcano, its peak is almost 2,000 meters above sea level. It's perfectly safe\u00a0-- the volcano has not erupted for 1,000 years\u00a0-- but Jeju's many caves retain the traces of lava's passage, and have long aroused the curiosity of travelers. The Manjanggul Lava Tube, (7.4km long), has a variety of cave formations including the world's largest lava column. The Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube and Ssangyonggul Cave, located in Hallim Park, is a spectacular example lava and limestone caves.Spectacular snow scenes on Hallasan MountainHallasan Mountain also captivates travelers with its snowscapes throughout the winter months. Numerous hiking trails boast a variety of snow-capped vistas, so\u00a0travelers can take their pick. The Seongpanak course, which goes to the beautiful Baengnokdam crater lake, is the most challenging, but also offers the best snow-covered views for hardy hikers prepared to make the winter trip. For beginners, they can choose the Yeongsil course, which is the shortest trail, or the Eorimok course, which has a relatively low slope. Travelers can\u00a0get to Hallasan\u00a0by just taking the bus. https://www.visitjeju.net/en/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500685# Winter in Jeju is not only white\u00a0-- it also glows red. Even in the snowy season, Jeju is adorned by winter-blooming camellias. Travelers can capture their beauty from many places. One of the best is the aptly named Camellia Hill, a botanical garden which features 6,000 camellia plants of 500 species, including the world's largest camellia. Or, visit Sinheung-ri Camellia Town, filled with the scent of camellias, and Seonheul-ri's Gotjawal, a unique virgin forest in a lava region.With daily connection flights from across Korea, and direct flights from origin markets including\u00a0Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand, Jeju Island is just waiting to be explored.About AgodaAgoda is one of the world's fastest growing online travel booking platforms.

(NASDAQ:\u00a0BKNG), today released a retrospective look back at this year's most popular dining trends. From trending reviews to dining behavior across the country, this year's diners are looking to have their cake and eat it too. \"We hit a major milestone this year - 10 billion diners seated, using our software. To put that in perspective, that's more than the world's population,\" said Andrea Johnston, COO at OpenTable. \"This year alone, we sat over 283 million diners who gave more than 13 million reviews. This uncovered a treasure trove of food trends and shifts in behavior to provide insightful context as to how people are eating in 2019.\" On OpenTable's plate in 2019, diners moved towards more health-conscious dining preferences. Alternative diets are also on the rise compared to 2017 with 'keto' mentioned a whopping 683 percent more in reviews and 'plant based' mentions increasing by 136 percent. Diners also vegged out on low-calorie alternatives with 'cauliflower crust' mentions skyrocketing in reviews by 487 percent and 'jackfruit,' another vegan and vegetarian alternative, increasing in reviews by 148 percent since 2017. Additionally, OpenTable found diners are still choosing to indulge when it comes to global cuisines. This past year, Mexican-inspired dishes continued to grow in popularity, with 'queso' mentions increasing by nearly 31 percent and 'nachos' mentions by 19 percent over the past three years. Review mentions of 'potstickers,' a staple in Asian cuisine, has increased by 61 percent.

Still, 42 percent say they actually plate their delivery meals with real silverware and plates to closely replicate the restaurant dining experience. For additional survey data on what Americans are getting delivered, where and how they are eating it and more, please visit the OpenTable blog. \"Since launching delivery options in July, we continue to hear how comfort and convenience are sometimes the priority for our diners along with top-notch, restaurant quality meals,\" said Joseph Essas, Chief Technology Officer at OpenTable. \"Our goal is to make OpenTable the go-to app for all dining occasions, and expanding our delivery capabilities with Postmates is one way we're addressing those priorities.\"Postmates serves more than 75% of US households and joins\u00a0Caviar,\u00a0Grubhub and\u00a0Uber Eats as the newest partner to offer delivery and pick-up options on OpenTable.

(NASDAQ: BKNG), announced new features designed to address one of the biggest challenges for restaurants and managers: control over table turns. According to OpenTable, the time that a restaurant expects a table to be occupied can vary from 45 minutes to 4 hours making it difficult for floor managers to optimize their seating.\u00a0 \"Controlling the pace of the dining room - how often tables turn over and when to fill them again - has significant financial impact for restaurants,\" said Jon Morin, OpenTable's VP of Product Management. \"We've designed two new features that react to incoming reservations in real time and which adapt to operating goals. 70 percent of our most popular restaurants use these turn and flow controls to run and grow their business.\"Flexible turn controls allow restaurateurs and their staff to define a minimum number of times a table will turn over by party size or table and only offer booking times that help reach that goal. Customizable flow controls assist with pacing tables to help the kitchen from getting backed up and keep staff's heads above water when the restaurant is at its busiest. Restaurant management can set these features, and then forget them. This frees up time to focus on guests, while the features do the hard work on their behalf. \"We've really enjoyed testing and experimenting with OpenTable's new controls,\" said Jon\u00e1s J. Mill\u00e1n, Restaurateur and Owner of the Juvia Group. \"The turn controls keeps moving, adjusting and adapting to how reservations come in. The feature gives you the power to control and increase your capacity in a controlled environment without jeopardizing the flow of the dining room.\"Restaurant groups can find out more about the turn and flow control features by visiting the OpenTable Open for Business blog here.About OpenTableOpenTable, part of Booking Holdings, Inc.
