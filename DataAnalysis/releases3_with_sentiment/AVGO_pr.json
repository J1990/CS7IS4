        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Oct 15, 2019 4:00AM EDT",
        "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct.  15, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced the availability of its BCM65450 family of G.fast modem devices. As telecom operators drive toward gigabit broadband via fiber deployments, the existing twisted pair copper infrastructure often remains the fastest and most cost-effective method to complete the customer premise connection. The BCM65450, with the highest G.fast density available, is designed specifically to bridge this fiber-copper gap and get the operator to gigabit services revenue in the shortest possible time. Together with the BCM68650 10G PON OLT solution also announced at the 2019 Broadband World Forum, the introduction of the BCM65450 demonstrates Broadcom\u2019s significant commitment in support of wireline broadband infrastructure.With four times the port density and 20% lower per-line power consumption than the widely deployed BCM65400 family, the BCM65450 is ideal for the highest-density multi-dwelling unit (MDU) and reverse-powered DPU system designs. Each BCM65450 device supports up to 16 G.fast 212MHz interfaces, with embedded crosstalk cancellation (\u2018vectoring\u2019) of up to three devices interconnected seamlessly for a fully-vectored 48-port MDU. Coupled with Broadcom\u2019s previously announced BCM65550 vector processor, system designs in excess of 100 lines are now possible with uncompromised crosstalk cancellation across the entire G.fast spectrum.The BCM65450 does more than increase density and improve efficiency. As a true copper infrastructure platform, it delivers on all of the critical innovations of the copper industry and standards bodies, including: echo-cancellation technology, offering the opportunity to use the full G.fast spectrum for simultaneous upstream and downstream transmission; G.fastback, now standardized in the ITU, a technique that extends gigabit coverage via G.fast backhauling and cascading; a dedicated line-bonding engine to provide previously unachievable multi-gigabit throughput over a set of bonded copper lines; and Dynamic Time Allocation to offer gigabit symmetrical services by dynamically adapting downstream and upstream rates. With all of these, plus fallback to earlier deployments of standardized DSL protocols, the BCM65450 is the ideal copper infrastructure solution for the gigabit broadband era.BCM65450 Product Highlights\u201cQuick deployment of ultrafast broadband across our territory is a critical requirement for A1,\u201d said Gerald Clerckx, head of Fixed Access Engineering at A1 Telekom Austria AG. \u201cIt is encouraging to see the continued leadership of Broadcom in offering the solution set necessary to realize this for both fiber and copper networks.\u201d \u201cThere is little debate that fiber is the future for gigabit broadband,\u201d noted Jeff Heynen, senior research director at Dell\u2019Oro Group. \u201cBut there still remains untapped potential in the existing twisted-pair copper plant. In many cases, a gigabit service can be offered quickly, and at far lower expense, by relying on G.fast for the final connection to the customer premise. Broadcom\u2019s BCM65450 solution addresses service provider demand for delivering gigabit broadband over copper.\u201d\u201cBroadcom\u2019s approach to broadband infrastructure has always been comprehensive; we look to deliver all the tools an operator needs to deploy the latest broadband protocols.\u00a0 The BCM65450 family, coupled with the BCM68650 we are also releasing at the Broadband World Forum, offers strong validation of this commitment. Through our system vendor partners we can now deliver all the technology required for a quick and cost-effective 10G fiber rollout, utilizing the physical plant assets available to each operator, with the minimum investment and operating expense,\u201d said Greg Fischer, senior vice president and general manager of the Broadband Carrier Access Products Division at Broadcom.AvailabilityBroadcom is now sampling its BCM65450 device to qualified customers.

Basis of PresentationBroadcom Inc. is the successor to Broadcom Limited for financial reporting purposes effective as of the close of trading on April 4, 2018. Information provided for fiscal periods beginning with the fiscal quarter ended May 6, 2018, relates to Broadcom Inc. and for prior fiscal periods relates to Broadcom Limited. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this press release to \"Broadcom,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" and similar terms are to Broadcom Inc. and, prior to that time, are to our predecessor, Broadcom Limited.The Company's financial results include contributions from CA, Inc.'s continuing operations starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The financial results from businesses that have been classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements are not included in the results presented above, unless otherwise stated.Due to the Company's 52/53 week reporting cycle, fiscal year 2018 included an extra week in the first quarter, compared to fiscal year 2019.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to GAAP reporting,\u00a0Broadcom\u00a0provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenue, and excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, impairment on investment, debt-related costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, gains\u00a0(losses)\u00a0on investments, income (loss) from discontinued operations and non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\u00a0Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.Broadcom\u00a0believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release.About Broadcom Inc.Broadcom Inc.
