This year, a panel of judges selected Paychex Flex\u00ae Assistant, the company's customer service chatbot, as a bronze winner for Best Use of Technology in Customer Service. \n                        \n                    \n                Presented annually, this year's Stevie Awards competition yielded more than 2,600 nominations from organizations in 48 nations of all sizes and industries. Winners were evaluated and determined by the average scores of more than 180 professionals worldwide on seven specialized judging committees.\"Stevie Award winners from around the world should be very proud of their achievements,\" said Michael Gallagher, Stevie Awards executive chairman. \"The judges were impressed with the vast range of nominations submitted for 2020 and have agreed that their accomplishments are worthy of public recognition.\" Embedded in its Paychex Flex\u00ae application and always accessible, Paychex Flex Assistant debuted in December 2018. Flex Assistant is an NLP-powered (natural language processing) chatbot that is intuitive and familiar to users who are accustomed to Google searching for answers to any given question. The bot answers 200+ questions that cover the breadth and depth of the Paychex HCM suite. Where the bot differentiates from many on the market is that if the user requires additional information or would like a live person, they are seamlessly connected to a specialist in real-time \u2013 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year \u2013 to get the answer they need. In addition, with customer experience as the top priority, all bot transactions are visible to the live Paychex service specialist, eliminating the need for users to repeat their reason for chatting and avoiding a frustrating user experience. \"With a focus on creating, delivering, and enhancing valuable client-facing services that promote efficiency and self-service for our 670,000+ customers, Paychex has undergone a significant digital transformation over the last decade,\" said Mike Gioja, Paychex SVP of IT and product development. \"Our Paychex Flex Assistant is a strong example of that shift and would not have been possible without a tight and ongoing partnership between the IT and Paychex service teams. Our goal of any chatbot session is that it ends with a successful result and a satisfied customer \u2013 through the bot, live agent chat, or phone call \u2013 24/7/365.\"Chatbots can be a powerful customer service tool that empowers customers, aids in discovery, and helps resolve common questions,\" added Gioja. \"However, they should augment the customer experience, not eliminate the human element. Paychex Flex Assistant brings users the perfect blend of customer service how they want it and a real-time human connection when they need it.\"Over the first two quarters of FY20, the Paychex Flex Assistant chatbot is successfully closing conversations more than 50 percent of the time.Details about the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service, as well as the full list of Stevie winners in all categories are available at stevieawards.com.About PaychexPaychex, Inc.

        "content": "ROCHESTER, N.Y., Feb. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Paychex, Inc., a leading provider of human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions, surveyed 500 business owners with 500 employees or less to better understand what issues are most important to their organizations as they prepare to go to the polls in November. While most business owners surveyed (72 percent) are experiencing growth, having increased their profits since 2018, the economy remains top of mind as Election Day approaches. In order of importance, the top issues for business owners are:\"Every business is unique, but the issues that keep business owners up at night are often universal,\" said Martin Mucci, Paychex president and CEO. \"The economy, taxes, and healthcare have historically been significant areas of focus for legislators and business owners alike and will clearly remain a priority during this election cycle. \"As November approaches, Paychex will continue to remain on top of these issues and how they may affect our 670,000 customers, helping them navigate the impacts they may have now or in the future,\" Mucci added. The most important issue among respondents varies depending on age. Business owners ages 39-54 and 55+ both ranked the economy as their top \"very important\" issue at 77 percent and 63 percent, respectfully. However, business owners ages 18-38 prioritized healthcare with 49 percent saying it's \"very important,\" followed closely by the economy at 46 percent. Ranking fourth overall on the list of issues, tariffs/trade policies are on the minds of many business owners, with 67 percent saying this matter is at least \"somewhat important.\" Businesses in the manufacturing sector, however, placed a higher level of importance on this issue with 80 percent saying it's at least \"somewhat important\" to them heading into the election season. The same can be said for businesses in the Midwest (78 percent).The current survey results align with the issues prioritized by business owners ahead of the 2016 election, as well. Four years ago, the most important issues to this group of voters were also the economy, taxes, and healthcare.For educational resources that can help businesses stay abreast of regulatory issues throughout the 2020 election season, visit paychex.com/WORX.\u00a0About the Paychex Business SurveyPaychex polled 500 randomly selected business owners with fewer than 500 employees.

        "content": "\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights\n\n(1) Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) measures.\u00a0 Please refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section on page 4 of this press release for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share.\n    ROCHESTER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nPaychex, Inc. (\u201cPaychex,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) (Nasdaq:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $990.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2019 (the \u201csecond quarter\u201d), an increase of 15% from $858.9 million for the same period last year. Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P. (\u201cOasis\u201d), acquired in December 2018, contributed approximately 9% to the growth in total revenue compared to the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $258.7 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.72 per share for the second quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both non-GAAP measures, each increased 8% to $253.8 million and $0.70 per share, respectively, for the second quarter.\n\nMartin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cDuring the second quarter, we delivered solid growth across our major business lines. In particular, our human resource (\u201cHR\u201d) outsourcing services, time and attendance solutions, and retirement services performed well.\u201d\n\nMucci added, \u201cWe are heavily focused on continued innovation to meet our customers\u2019 and their employees' evolving needs, simplifying HR complexities and offering solutions to help them thrive and grow. We are investing in innovative technology in the areas of flexible payments, integrations, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, while still maintaining our commitment to personalized service. Our state-of-the-art technology and exceptional service distinguish us in the market as we deliver a more personalized and technology-enhanced experience for our clients and their employees.\u201d\n\nManagement Solutions revenue was $726.7 million for the second quarter, a 6% increase compared to the same period last year. Oasis contributed slightly less than 1% to the growth in Management Solutions revenue compared to the same period last year. The remaining increase was primarily driven by increases in our client base and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services, and HR outsourcing. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participants\u2019 funds.\n\nProfessional employer organization (\u201cPEO\u201d) and Insurance Services revenue was $244.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 57% compared to the same period last year. Oasis contributed approximately 47% to the growth in PEO and Insurance Services revenue compared to the same period last year. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, this increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our PEO business. Insurance Services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants, offset by the impact of softness in the workers\u2019 compensation market as state insurance fund rates declined.\n\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 9% to $19.9 million for the second quarter, compared to the same period last year. The increase resulted from higher realized gains, average investment balances, and average interest rates. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our client base, offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances.\n\nAverage investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:\n\nTotal expenses increased 18% to $649.0 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs, and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth for the second quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis.\n\nOperating income increased 11% to $341.7 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter, compared to 35.8% for the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter was primarily impacted by the continued growth of our PEO business, including the acquisition of Oasis, and by increased investments in technology and certain business initiatives. EBITDA(1) increased 16% to $398.8 million for the second quarter and EBITDA margin(1) was 40% for the second quarter, consistent with the same period last year.\n\nOther expense, net for the second quarter of $4.7 million includes interest expense of $8.3 million related to our long-term borrowings.\n\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. The effective income tax rates in both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments.\n\nYear-To-Date Fiscal 2020 Highlights\n\nThe highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2019 (the \u201csix months\u201d) are as follows:\n\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\n\nOur financial position as of November 30, 2019 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $707.8 million. Total short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs were $847.9 million as of November 30, 2019. Our positive cash flows have historically allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends (approximately 80% of net income) to our stockholders. We anticipate that cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of November 30, 2019, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\n\nCash flows from operations were $564.6 million for the six months, an increase of 14% from the same period last year. The increase in our operating cash flows was the result of higher net income and non-cash adjustments. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Oasis, offset by a lower provision for deferred income taxes.\n\nDuring the six months, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock for a total of $171.9 million. In the respective prior year period, we repurchased 0.5 million shares for a total of $32.8 million.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue), which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). As such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\n\nOutlook \n\nOur outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020 (\u201cfiscal 2020\u201d), is based upon current market expectations and economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. We have updated our guidance as a result of current business trends. Our updated guidance is as follows:\n\nOther aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2020 remain unchanged from what we provided previously.\n\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q\n\nWe anticipate filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\u201cForm 10-Q\u201d) for the second quarter within the next few days, and it will be available at our Investor Relations Page. This press release should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-Q and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in that Form 10-Q.\n\nConference Call\n\nInterested parties may access the webcast of our Earnings Release Conference Call, scheduled for December 18, 2019 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, at our Investor Relations Page. The webcast will be archived for approximately one month. Our news releases, current financial information, SEC filings, and investor presentations are also accessible at our Investor Relations Page.\n\nAbout Paychex\n\nPaychex, Inc.

        "title": "Paychex Identifies the Top 10 Regulatory Issues for Employers in 2020",
        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Dec 12, 2019 2:03PM EST",
        "content": "ROCHESTER, N.Y., Dec. 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Paychex, Inc., a leading provider of HR technology solutions for human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance services, today identified the top 10 regulatory issues that employers should be aware of and prepared for in 2020. As business owners and HR managers plan for the year ahead, the list outlines the compliance topics that should be kept top of mind as they are likely to shape the legislative and regulatory landscape of the next 12 months, especially heading into an unpredictable election year.\"Business owners must be prepared for regulatory changes at the federal, state, and local levels across a multitude of different issues,\" said Martin Mucci, president and CEO of Paychex. \"It's more challenging than ever for employers to track, understand, and implement these complex and ever-changing laws. With our annual summary of timely regulatory developments, we hope to simplify some of these compliance challenges for business owners and HR leaders.\"Here are the top 10 regulatory issues compliance experts at Paychex have identified for 2020:#1 Form W-4 Changes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 forced a revision of the federal withholding process, culminating in a brand-new Form W-4 for use in 2020. Key changes include the elimination of withholding allowances and the ability for taxpayers to have more tax withheld to address the concerns of those who have had to unexpectedly pay tax when filing in the years following the tax reform legislation. All new employees hired as of January 1, 2020 must complete the new form. Existing employees are not required to complete a new form but can choose to adjust their withholding based on the new form. Any adjustments made after January 1, 2020 must be made using the new form. Employers, therefore, must be prepared to compute employees' withholdings based on both the old and new versions of the Form W-4. With the release of the new federal form and revised withholding tables, individual states must also determine if they will update their systems based on the federal changes, keep their current process, or develop a new withholding process. A few states have already made their determinations, but the majority have yet to decide.#2 Final Overtime Rule.\u00a0In September 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced its long-awaited Final Overtime Rule to revise the federal regulations governing which employees are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay under the federal wage and hour law. Among other changes, the Final Overtime Rule raises the \"standard salary\" for the executive, administrative and professional white collar exemptions from the currently enforced level of $455 to $684 per week (equivalent to $35,568 per year for a full-year worker), effective January 1, 2020. The new rule also allows employers to use non-discretionary bonuses and certain incentive payments (including commissions) that are paid at least annually to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level in a 52-week period. #3 Worker Classification. Worker classification continues to be addressed by enforcing agencies, in the courts and in local and state legislatures across the country. Perhaps the most impactful legislation this year, especially for workers of ridesharing services, is California AB5, effective January in 2020.\u00a0 The new law will require employers to demonstrate a worker satisfies a three-part (ABC) test to be classified as an independent contractor in the state. Other state and local legislatures are considering similar legislation. #4 Multiple Payment Options Available to Businesses.\u00a0In 2020, the rapid expansion of multiple faster payment options to send and receive funds will continue. New developments include the roll out of the Clearinghouse's Real Time Payments network and the expansion of same-day ACH for businesses and pay-on-demand products that allow workers to receive pay as it is earned. These convenient electronic payment options will continue to make non-cash payments increasingly popular. Businesses interested in improving their cash flow through utilizing these faster payment options and assisting their employees with financial flexibility should consult with their financial institution or payroll provider for more information on available payment options. #5 Privacy.\u00a0Employers need to be mindful of the impact various privacy related regulations have on the way they do business. One of the more actively discussed regulations going in to 2020 will continue to be the California Consumer Privacy Act, (CCPA). Even though employers have been exempted from many of the CCPA requirements for one year, until January 1, 2021, the notice provision will still apply. What this means is that any business that meets the CCPA criteria is required to provide employees with a privacy policy notice. The CCPA requirements will continue to undergo additional refinements as the Attorney General begins to issue final guidance in 2020. Additionally, more employers are utilizing biometrics to identify employees and track hours worked. However, unlike other methods of authentication such as passwords, ID cards, etc., biometric identifiers cannot be changed once compromised. Employers that use biometrics need to be aware of regulations such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) that are emerging at the state level.\u00a0 #6 Health Care Reform.\u00a0Many health care regulations have shifted under the current administration, including Association Health Plans (AHPs), Short-Term Limited Duration Insurance (STLDI), and Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs). Additional changes include the removal of the federal penalty under the individual mandate. In some cases, these changes have prompted states to take legal action to shape the health coverage in their geographies, including instituting their own individual mandate or further limiting the federal rules of AHPs and STLDI in their jurisdiction. As a result, employers may have some new alternatives and new obligations when it comes to employees' health care options, depending on where they live, but these choices are often complex. Employers should be cognizant that the current landscape is fluid, and both state and federal elections in 2020 have the potential to alter this trajectory in various geographies.\u00a0 #7 Employer Shared Responsibility Enforcement.\u00a0The IRS continues to expand and refine its enforcement of the Employer Shared Responsibility (ESR) provisions. In addition to the IRS 226J letters, which include the preliminary calculations for ESR payments for not offering adequate affordable insurance to full-time employees, the IRS has begun assessing penalties for untimely or non-filing of the information returns 1094-C/1095-C. The good-faith-effort relief for filing inaccurate or incomplete returns was recently extended, but this relief did not apply if the returns were not filed timely and these penalties can be substantial. As the IRS continues to enhance its enforcement efforts, applicable large employers (ALEs) should ensure they do their due diligence to report information on Forms 1094-C/1095-C in a timely and accurate manner, as well as respond promptly to any notice received from the IRS. #8 Sexual Harassment Prevention.\u00a0The #MeToo movement continued to drive increased attention to the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace in 2019. In response, state and city legislatures, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York state, and New York City, passed legislation and developed regulations that included provisions to implement or expand employer requirements for workplace sexual harassment prevention policies and/or training. All employers should consider examining their internal processes for addressing inappropriate behavior in the workplace and creating a safe, respectful environment for all employees and non-employees.#9 Paid Family Leave and Paid Sick Leave. Many\u00a0state and local jurisdictions have implemented paid sick leave laws, and eight states and Washington, D.C., have passed legislation to implement paid family and medical leave programs to provide eligible employees with benefits in the form of partial wages when taking leave to care for themselves or a covered family member. Bipartisan interest in a paid family leave law at the federal level also exists, with several proposals being considered at this time. Also trending in 2019, Maine; Nevada; and Bernalillo County, New Mexico passed paid leave laws requiring employers to provide paid time off to eligible employees without requiring a reason for the leave. #10 Marijuana Legalization.\u00a0State and local jurisdictions continue to enact legislation that addresses decriminalization of marijuana, recognition of medical marijuana use, and/or legalization of recreational marijuana. Currently, 11 states and Washington D.C. have passed legislation to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes. Employers must stay apprised of these legal developments as well as court decision and consider adjusting their risk mitigation strategies, including workplace policies to allow for accommodations where applicable for the lawful use of marijuana for medicinal purposes and the parameters of existing drug testing programs.For a slideshow of 2020's top 10 regulatory issues, visit Paychex WORX.Keeping up with regulations is a challenge for today's business owners and HR leaders.

As part of the third annual report \u2013 The 2020 Index of Intelligent Tools in HR Technology \u2013 Paychex, Inc., a leading provider of HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions, appears on the Watchlist for the first time. \"Legacy providers have massive market advantages over startups,\" noted John Sumser, HRExaminer founder and principal analyst, in the report. \"With large datasets and existing customers, it's easier to see intelligent tools as a path to increased customer satisfaction while reducing overall costs. Paychex is demonstrating that a broad-spectrum utilization of 'AI' tools can strengthen existing operations.\"Sumser based the Watchlist on 450 hours of in-depth interviews with 110 organizations globally.\"The sheer volume of data at our disposal allows us to deploy AI and machine learning principles more effectively than most organizations,\" said Mike Gioja, Paychex senior vice president of IT and product development. \"Our product development strategy today enables us to automate where it makes sense to do so and, in turn, deliver a more personalized, optimized user experience. We do all of this while making the security and privacy of our customers' data a top priority.\"Paychex Flex\u00ae Assistant, the company's customer-facing service chatbot, can currently answer 200 questions spanning the Paychex Flex suite \u2013 from recruiting and onboarding to engagement and retirement \u2013 with more questions being added as the bot matures. The chatbot also seamlessly integrates with real-time live chat capability, functionality that connects users with a live Paychex service agent if Paychex Flex Assistant cannot yet answer their question. All chatbot transactions are visible to the live Paychex service agent, eliminating the need for users to repeat their question to the live agent. Since its introduction in December 2018, Paychex Flex Assistant has handled more than a half million transactions.Paychex underpins other aspects of the Paychex Flex architecture with intelligent tools, as well, leveraging AI and machine learning to deliver a more personalized user experience (UX) for its millions of monthly users. This approach leads to a more predictive UX, as the system learns individual user preferences over time and makes real-time recommendations for things like a custom dashboard or the user's learning preferences for application help.\"I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made as a technology-focused organization, and recognitions like this prove that work is paying off,\" Gioja added. \"However, as an organization with a history of providing world-class service, we will never lose sight of the value in blending humans and machines. Our AI doesn't replace human interactions, but rather allows us and our customers to engage in more high-value human touchpoints because we've automated a lot of the routine interactions.\"In addition to customer-facing solutions, Paychex regularly leverages Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to complete simple, repetitive tasks behind the scenes. RPA powers the company's approach to automated payroll processing and appointment scheduling, for example, saving thousands of hours in manual work. Additionally, leveraging consistent monitoring of client profiles and key transactions across millions of users, automated routines distribute Paychex Flex users to the most appropriate infrastructure, resulting in optimal application performance.To view the HRExaminer 2020 Watchlist for AI in HR, visit hrexaminer.com.
