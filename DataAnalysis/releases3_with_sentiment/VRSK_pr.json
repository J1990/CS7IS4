This expansion will enable agents and businesses to engage and closely collaborate with insurers by sharing video surveys of commercial properties in real time, helping insurers and their customers accelerate the underwriting process.\u201cCommercial property insurers often rely on sight-unseen or unverified data when underwriting a policy, especially since conducting in-person surveys of some properties can be time-consuming and expensive and can delay quotes,\u201d said Maroun Mourad, president of global underwriting at Verisk. \u201cOneXperience provides agents and policyholders with the ability to conduct live-feed video surveys of commercial properties in collaboration with insurers. Insurers can improve digital engagement with customers and make quicker underwriting decisions with confidence.\u201dOneXperience provides insurers with the ability to engage digitally, empowering them to conduct real-time virtual surveys of commercial buildings, obtain critical insights, and share photos, forms, and documents with all stakeholders. OneXperience, launched last year for home inspections, is built on proven virtual technology: Shared architecture, already used by many insurers for claim settlement through Verisk\u2019s ClaimXperience\u00ae platform, is now enabled to facilitate workflow integration throughout the policy life cycle from quote to claim.With OneXperience, insurers can direct the survey to reveal granular details on potential risks and eliminate the gaps between actual conditions at the property and the coverage being provided. Insurers can also use OneXperience to request that Verisk review data submitted through the platform and provide analysis. The platform can be used by agents and insureds at multiple points of engagement from quote to renewal.For more information, visit http://www.verisk.com/onexperience-cl..About Verisk\u00a0 Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) is a leading data analytics provider serving customers in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services.

        "content": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb.  28, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading data analytics provider, is launching its new analytics platform for automated underwriting of life insurance in collaboration with SCOR, a Tier 1 global reinsurer. Verisk\u2019s new analytics platform is designed to help improve the life insurance buying experience for consumers and support insurers\u2019 digital transformation. The solution uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help life insurers ingest and interpret electronic health records (EHRs) for real-time underwriting decisions once the appropriate consumer consents have been obtained.\u201cElectronic medical records have the potential to become a critical source of data for life insurers looking to streamline underwriting and transform the customer experience,\u201d said Maroun Mourad, president of global underwriting at Verisk. \u201cBut it\u2019s been difficult for many insurers to extract and interpret unstructured EHR data, such as doctor\u2019s notes, and make decisions based on the available data. Our new analytics platform\u2014which we\u2019re developing in collaboration with SCOR Global Life\u2014uses advanced AI to automate the process: ingesting EHRs, analyzing their structured and unstructured data, and applying the insurer\u2019s underwriting guidelines.\u201d\u00a0The new platform will pull records from EHR providers and apply machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to analyze both the structured and unstructured data in those records. The platform will return a score based on Verisk\u2019s medically researched underwriting model. That score can then be modified by insurers based on their proprietary underwriting insights.This solution is ultimately intended to substantially reduce the time needed to obtain an attending physician statement and enable accelerated underwriting. The scores will be validated against SCOR Global Life\u2019s underwriting manual and vetted by its medical research and data science teams.\u00a0\u201cOur collaboration with Verisk demonstrates our investment in underwriting innovation in order to make life insurance more readily available and more relevant,\u201d said J.C. Brueckner, CEO of SCOR Global Life \u2013 U.S. \u201cAccess to electronic medical information is essential for life insurers using rules-based decision models for accelerated underwriting. Over time, implementation of EHRs will boost process optimization, lower costs, and reduce application time. By working with Verisk on its new platform, we\u2019ll be helping develop a solution that our clients can use to improve the customer journey and extend protection and peace of mind, which is central to our purpose as a reinsurer.\u201dVerisk plans to incorporate the new solution into SCOR Global Life\u2019s Velogica underwriting system as well as make it available via a stand-alone API.

Our dividend increase of 8% underscores our confidence in our long-term growth, the stability of our business, and our capital management discipline.\u201dSummary of Results (GAAP and Non-GAAP)(in millions, except per share amounts)Note: Adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.RevenuesConsolidated revenues increased 10.2% for fourth-quarter 2019 and 5.4% on an OCC basis. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, which adjusts for $5 million of associated revenue in the prior year period, OCC revenue grew 6.3% in fourth-quarter 2019.Revenues and Revenue Growth by Segment(in millions)Insurance segment revenues grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 5.2% on an OCC basis.Energy and Specialized Markets segment revenue increased 23.3% in the quarter and 7.1% on an OCC basis, resulting primarily from increases in market and cost intelligence solutions, core research revenues, and environmental health and safety service revenues.Financial Services segment revenue decreased 0.3% in the quarter and increased 2.1% on an OCC basis. Fraud and credit risk management solutions as well as portfolio management solutions experienced growth, but this was partially offset by declines in enterprise data management revenues.Net Income and Adjusted EBITDANet income decreased 9.6%, negatively affected by higher acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) and a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.3%, and on an OCC basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 9.0% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, which adjusts for $5 million of associated revenue in the prior year period, OCC adjusted EBITDA grew 11.0% for fourth-quarter 2019. These increases were positively affected by leverage on solid sales growth and cost discipline.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment(in millions)Note: Consolidated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Margin is calculated as a percentage of revenues.Earnings Per ShareDiluted EPS decreased 8.0% to $0.80 for the fourth quarter of 2019 due to higher acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) and a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the prior-year period.Diluted adjusted EPS grew 8.7% to $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and lower average share count. These increases were offset in part by increases in depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and a higher effective tax rate.Cash FlowNet cash provided by operating activities was $176 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 1.7%. Capital expenditures were $64 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, down 16.3%. Free cash flow was $112 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 16.0%, primarily due to lower capital expenditures.Free cash flow represented 35.3% of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 33.5% in the prior-year period.Business Portfolio ChangesThe company has recently engaged in a series of transactions that focus our portfolio of businesses and position Verisk for continued long-term sustainable growth. On February 1, 2020, the company closed on the previously announced sale of its aerial imagery sourcing group to Vexcel Imaging in exchange for a minority interest in Vexcel.\u00a0This transaction creates a leading geospatial data library to which Verisk will have full access.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), nonrecurring gain/loss, and interest income on the subordinated promissory note. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. The company believes these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow for greater transparency regarding the company\u2019s operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax; and (v) interest income on the subordinated promissory note, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. The company believes these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of the company\u2019s results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. The company believes free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the company\u2019s operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase its stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Organic Constant Currency (OCC): The company\u2019s operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, it presents certain constant currency financial information to assess how the company performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\u00a0The company calculates constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. The company defines \u201corganic\u201d as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) that have occurred over the past year.\u00a0An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date.\u00a0Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP).\u00a0Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. The organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison. A disposition\u2019s results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability. The company believes organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors\u2019 understanding of the continuing operating performance of its business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.See page 11 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA.

Data within the Guidewire system is automatically mapped to the A-PLUS record layout, saving insurers the time and expense of manually formatting and uploading this data to Verisk.The new accelerators build on several Verisk data tools already available for users of Guidewire InsuranceSuite and A-PLUS auto and property. Guidewire customers that submit loss history data to Verisk are immediately eligible to purchase the A-PLUS auto and property data ordering service and quickly access loss history data from Verisk using existing accelerators from the Guidewire Marketplace: A-PLUS Auto for PolicyCenter and A-PLUS Property Integration for PolicyCenter.In addition, new contributing carriers will be able to take advantage of the A-PLUS Claims Activity Profiler, which enables insurers to optimize loss history report costs via an innovative point-of-quote indicator of an applicant\u2019s existing claims history.

        "content": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., Jan.  22, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading data analytics provider, has introduced TrueVIN, a new way for insurers to gain greater insight into detailed physical attributes of vehicles they cover. TrueVIN, the advanced vehicle identification number (VIN) decoder, provides insurers with precise details about how cars and trucks are equipped from the factory, using the complete 17-digit VIN.\u201cA more comprehensive picture of the vehicle is now available, featuring critical information about physical characteristics that often aren\u2019t encoded in the VIN itself,\u201d said Jimmy Engstr\u00f6m, director of analytic products at ISO, a Verisk business. \u201cWithout access to build sheet data, those vehicle characteristics can be hard to identify, especially for equipment that\u2019s optional. Having that granular knowledge can be extremely helpful in pricing the coverage correctly for the specific vehicle that\u2019s being insured.\u201dTrueVIN can uncover vehicle-specific, as-built details, such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and high repair-cost equipment like panoramic sunroofs. The solution supports ISO\u2019s recently introduced ADAS rating factors, which include a manual rule and related rating factors for the ISO Personal Auto Program. Both TrueVIN and the ADAS rating factors can help insurers seamlessly account for the presence of these safety features when underwriting and pricing coverage.\u201cWith the spread of ADAS technology such as blind spot intervention, lane departure prevention, and forward collision warning, it\u2019s valuable for insurers to know precisely which features are installed on a specific vehicle,\u201d said Jared Smollik, vice president of personal lines actuarial and analytic products at ISO. \u201cOur analysis of these technologies has revealed a range of implications due to safety on the road as well as repair costs when this sensitive equipment is damaged in accidents.\u201dTrueVIN functions within Verisk\u2019s full suite of ADAS solutions that range from rating factors to VIN-level identification of ADAS features for supporting micro-segmentation of risk.For more information about TrueVIN, visit verisk.com/truevin.About Verisk Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) is a leading data analytics provider serving customers in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services.

        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Jan 16, 2020 12:02PM EST",
        "content": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., Jan.  16, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u00a0The private U.S. property/casualty insurance industry saw its net underwriting gains increase to $5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019 from $4.7 billion a year earlier, bolstered by growth in premiums and a drop in catastrophe losses, and its surplus reach a record high of $812.2 billion, according to Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading data analytics provider, and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA).The surplus grew $70.1 billion in nine-months 2019 as the stock market recovered from a significant downturn at the end of 2018.The industry\u2019s net income after taxes and underwriting gains remained strong despite small declines compared with the prior year. Net income after taxes declined to $48.1 billion for nine-months 2019 from $49.4 billion a year earlier, and insurers\u2019 combined ratio deteriorated to 97.8% from 97.4% a year earlier. Net losses and loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes declined to $21.5 billion for nine-months 2019 from $26.0 billion a year earlier.Net written premium growth slowed to 2.7% in nine-months 2019, after jumping 11.4% a year earlier; in both years, growth was significantly affected by one-time increases in net written premiums caused by the changes multiple insurers made to their reinsurance arrangements in 2018. Net earned premiums grew 4.7%.\u201cThe strong economy, along with a drop in catastrophe losses, has helped insurers continue to enjoy strong results and build a record surplus,\u201d said Neil Spector, president of ISO. \u201cBut as competition grows and customer expectations rise, insurers increasingly need to boost the speed and precision of their decisions, from underwriting to claims. Those carriers equipped with robust data, powerful analytics, and experienced talent will be the best poised to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. property/casualty insurers\u2019 financial results during the first nine months of 2019 paint a picture of a strong industry with a rock-solid foundation that enables consumers to rest assured that they will be protected when they need it most,\u201d said Robert Gordon, senior vice president for policy, research and international, at APCIA. \u201cInsurers\u2019 capital gains increased during 2019 as global markets rebounded from their worst quarterly fall in seven years during the fourth quarter of 2018. While insurers\u2019 investment income and net income after taxes declined, industry surplus grew, creating an increasingly stable underwriting foundation.\u201dThird-Quarter ResultsInsurers\u2019 net income after taxes fell to $15.3 billion in third-quarter 2019 from $15.4 billion in third-quarter 2018. Their combined ratio improved to 98.8% in third-quarter 2019 from 99.7% a year earlier.Net written premiums rose $9.8 billion, or 6.2%, to $166.2 billion in third-quarter 2019 from $156.5 billion in third-quarter 2018.The contribution of underwriting activities was essentially zero; that is, underwriting had break-even results in third-quarter 2019, which contrasts with a $1.3 billion net underwriting loss in third-quarter 2018.View the full report from Verisk and APCIA here.

        "title": "AER Scientists Lead Review Article on the Relationship between Severe Winter Weather and Arctic Warmth",
        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Jan 13, 2020 9:00AM EST",
        "content": "Lexington, Mass., Jan.  13, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new review article published in Nature Climate Change evaluates the contentious topic of whether severe winter weather in the United States, Europe, and Asia is sensitive to Arctic temperatures. The lead author is Dr. Judah Cohen, director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) business.Despite a warming planet, winter weather has remained surprisingly resilient across the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere; and the winter weather headlines have often been about severe cold, heavy snowfalls, and the polar vortex. The unexpected frequency of severe winter weather was not projected by global climate models used to study climate change. It has been challenging for climate scientists to attribute the recent streak of cold, snowy winters to a particular cause.One relatively novel idea has been to attribute severe winter weather across the United States, Europe, and Asia to Arctic amplification, the accelerated warming of the Arctic region at a rate 2 to 3 times faster than the rest of the globe. This accelerated Arctic warming was thought to be mostly due to rapidly melting Arctic sea ice. By contrast, the review article discusses why Arctic warming\u2014which is faster than warming in all other regions\u2014is complicated and not solely due to melting sea ice or snow cover. Increasing water vapor and clouds as well as the transport of heat and moisture from lower latitudes are all contributing to accelerated Arctic warming.Much of the study discusses whether Arctic amplification, including decreasing Arctic sea ice and increasing Eurasian snow cover extent in the fall, is contributing to more severe winter weather across the midlatitudes. The idea is strongly debated among climate scientists and is considered controversial; therefore, until now, the topic has been considered lacking consensus. But the authors of the review article argue there are actually two divergent camps of consensus.\u00a0One camp of consensus represents the observational studies that strongly argue that Arctic amplification is contributing to more severe winter weather. Low Arctic sea ice coupled with high Eurasian snow cover extent in the fall is ideally located for amplifying naturally occurring waves in the atmosphere that are most favorable for disrupting the polar vortex. Following polar vortex disruptions, the probability of severe winter weather in the United States, Europe, and Asia is greater for up to two months. During the past two winters, polar vortex disruptions unleashed record cold, the \u201cbomb cyclone,\u201d the \u201cBeast from the East,\u201d and other notable severe winter weather events across the United States, Europe, and Asia.The other camp of consensus cites studies based on simulations of low Arctic sea ice using global climate models. The majority of those studies conclude that any observed increase in recent severe winter weather is likely due to chance and not Arctic amplification. In the simulations, sea ice loss does not result in more polar vortex disruptions and contributes to milder winter weather (not severe winter weather) across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Therefore, as the Arctic continues to experience profound changes, it will only contribute to milder winters across the Northern Hemisphere, according to these simulations.\u201cThe publication of the paper is especially timely given the extreme winters of 2017/18 and 2018/19 in the U.S., including Alaska and Canada, with a record-warm Arctic and low sea ice especially near Alaska; record-breaking polar vortex disruptions; record-breaking cold; disruptive snowfalls, including severe \u2018bomb cyclones\u2019; and costly nor\u2019easters,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cCorrectly attributing these disruptive weather events to Arctic change or not should help society better anticipate these events and make the appropriate preparations. Also, properly contextualizing severe winter weather vis-\u00e0-vis Arctic change will better educate society to understand the full impacts of climate change.\u201dCohen adds, \u201cRealizing the dichotomy between observational and modeling studies will possibly break the impasse the climate community is experiencing in trying to understand the linkages between the Arctic and midlatitude weather.\u201dThe research is funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and Office of Polar Programs.The study can be viewed here.About Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) provides science-based solutions to global environmental challenges.
