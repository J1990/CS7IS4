This is a result of SoftBank agreeing to surrender approximately 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to New T-Mobile immediately following the closing of the transaction, making SoftBank\u2019s effective ratio 11.31 Sprint shares per T-Mobile share. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of approximately 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share.\n\nImmediately following the closing, and after the surrender of shares by SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank are expected to hold approximately 43% and 24%, respectively, of the fully diluted New T-Mobile shares, with the remaining approximately 33% held by public shareholders.\n\nT-Mobile has agreed to re-issue to SoftBank the previously surrendered shares upon the achievement of certain stock price milestones by New T-Mobile during a specified measurement period, and subject to certain additional terms, as outlined in the letter agreement that will be filed by each of T-Mobile and Sprint with the SEC.\n\nIn addition, the amendment extends the \u201coutside date\u201d under the Business Combination Agreement to July 1, 2020, and modifies certain other provisions of the Business Combination Agreement as described in the companies\u2019 SEC filings.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is another significant step forward toward finally closing this transaction! Throughout this journey, T-Mobile and Sprint have been singularly focused on one thing: building a supercharged Un-carrier that will offer U.S. consumers a broad and deep nationwide 5G network, more choice and greater competition. We are now on the threshold of achieving our goal. And did I mention how fun it\u2019s going to be sticking it to Dumb, Dumber and Big Cable along the way? This is going to be epic!\u201d said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s agreement in place, we are now turning our attention toward our goal of closing this transaction and creating the New T-Mobile as early as April 1, 2020,\u201d said Mike Sievert, COO and President of T-Mobile, and appointed CEO of the company starting on May 1, 2020. \u201cWe are on the verge of being able to do what we\u2019ve set out to do from day one -- reshape a broken wireless industry and create the new standard for consumers when it comes to value, speed, quality and service. The New T-Mobile is literally going to change wireless for good and now we\u2019re almost ready to get to the fun part: bringing our teams together, building this supercharged Un-carrier and becoming the envy of the wireless industry and beyond!\u201d\n\n\u201cCompleting this step is yet another critical milestone in securing Sprint\u2019s future, and it brings us one step closer to closing this historic transaction that has been years in the making,\u201d said Marcelo Claure, Sprint Executive Chairman. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly thankful for the perseverance and resilience of everyone that has gotten us to this point.\u201d\n\nThe T-Mobile and Sprint combination remains subject to certain closing conditions.

EBITDA of $3.2B\n    BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS):\n\nRecord Financial Performance (all percentages year-over-year)\n\nStrong Customer Growth\n\nFirst Nationwide 5G Network\n\nStrong Standalone Outlook for 2020\n\n____________________________________________\n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) once again delivered incredible results in the fourth quarter of 2019, reporting strong net customer additions including 1.9 million total net customer additions, the 27th quarter in a row with more than 1 million total net customer additions. Our 1.0 million branded postpaid phone net customer additions led the industry once again. For full-year 2019, T-Mobile had 7.0 million total net customer additions, including 4.5 million branded postpaid net customer additions - beating its increased customer guidance range of 4.1 to 4.3 million for the full-year 2019. In addition, we reported all-time record-high financial results, including service and total revenues, as well as record Q4 Adjusted EBITDA. These results concluded another record-breaking year for the Un-carrier, in which we delivered strong customer growth and record financial results for the full-year 2019 - once again beating our full-year guidance.\n\nIn December 2019, T-Mobile launched America\u2019s first nationwide 5G network, including prepaid 5G with Metro by T-Mobile, covering more than 200 million people and more than 5,000 cities and towns across the United States with 5G. In addition, we introduced two new 600 MHz 5G capable superphones, the exclusive OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G and anticipate offering an industry-leading smartphone portfolio built to work on nationwide 5G in 2020. This 5G network is the foundational layer of 5G coverage and it\u2019s just the beginning! With the New T-Mobile, we will be able to combine this foundational layer of 5G with Sprint\u2019s 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum, resulting in a broad and deep nationwide 5G experience for everyone, everywhere. And, T-Mobile continues to invest in building its nationwide 4G LTE network, which now covers 327 million Americans, and continues to rapidly deploy its 600 MHz spectrum, which now covers 248 million people, and is live in nearly 8,900 cities and towns across 49 states and Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cT-Mobile continues to deliver incredible results quarter after quarter! In Q4 we set new financial records across the board and recorded our 27th consecutive quarter with over 1 million total net customer additions,\u201d said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. \u201cWe achieved these spectacular results all while launching the first and only nationwide 5G network, announcing Un-carrier 1.0 for New T-Mobile, and delivering a compelling and fact-based argument in court to support our pending merger. Our results continue to show that the Un-carrier strategy works, and it delivers for both customers and shareholders. I couldn\u2019t be more confident and excited about our future and We Won\u2019t Stop!\u201d\n\nStrong Customer Growth\n\nT-Mobile continues to deliver strong customer growth, and in Q4 2019 set a record of 27 consecutive quarters of more than 1 million total net customer additions. We once again led the industry in branded postpaid phone net customer additions.\n\nRecord Financial Performance\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s strong financial performance in Q4 2019 and full-year 2019 proves that our strategy is not only good for customers, it\u2019s also good for stockholders. We continue to successfully translate customer growth into industry-leading service revenue growth.\n\nThe following discussion is for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same periods in 2018 unless otherwise stated.\n\nFirst Nationwide 5G Network\n\nT-Mobile continues to expand the footprint and improve the quality of its network to better serve its customers. 327 million Americans are covered by our 4G LTE network, and our rapid deployment of 600 MHz spectrum provides customers with even better coverage and supports the launch of our nationwide 5G network. Highlights from Q4 2019 include:\n\nStrong Standalone Outlook for 2020\n\nThe following represents T-Mobile standalone guidance.\n\nWe expect postpaid net customer additions between 2.6 and 3.6 million in 2020.\n\nNet income is not available on a forward-looking basis.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $13.7 to $14.0 billion in 2020. Our Adjusted EBITDA target includes leasing revenues of $450 to $550 million and takes into account our network expansion, including the continued deployment of our 600 MHz spectrum and 5G network.\n\nCash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, are expected to be between $5.9 and $6.2 billion for full-year 2020. Cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be between $5.5 and $5.8 billion. We expect that cash purchases of property and equipment will be heavily weighted to early in the year, similar to 2019.\n\nIn Q1 2020, pre-close merger-related costs are expected to be $200 to $300 million before taxes.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities, excluding payments for merger-related costs and any settlement of interest rate swaps, is expected to be in the range of $7.9 to $8.5 billion.\n\nFree Cash Flow, excluding payments for merger-related costs and any settlement of interest rate swaps, is expected to be in the range of $5.4 to $5.8 billion. We expect a similar seasonal development of Free Cash Flow in 2020 as in 2019 with a lower Free Cash Flow in the first quarter, ramping in later quarters, based on expected timing for cash purchases of property and equipment.\n\nFinancial Results\n\nFor more details on T-Mobile\u2019s Q4 2019 financial results, including the Investor Factbook with detailed financial tables and reconciliations of certain historical non-GAAP measures disclosed in this release to the most comparable measures under GAAP, please visit T-Mobile US, Inc.\u2019s Investor Relations website at http://investor.t-mobile.com.\n\nT-Mobile Social Media\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial and operational information to our investors using our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.

No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n\nThis Press Release includes non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. T-Mobile is not able to forecast Net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income including, but not limited to, Income tax expense, stock-based compensation expense and Interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict Net income as the difference between the two measures is variable.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is reconciled to Net income as follows:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA - Earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of T-Mobile\u2019s ongoing operating performance, such as merger-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by T-Mobile\u2019s management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. T-Mobile uses Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate its personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate T-Mobile\u2019s operating performance in comparison to its competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of T-Mobile\u2019s ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of Interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the Transactions, as they are not indicative of T-Mobile\u2019s ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, Net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n\nNet debt (excluding tower obligations)(1) to last twelve months net income and Adjusted EBITDA ratios are calculated as follows:\n\nNet debt is defined as Short-term debt, Short-term debt to affiliates, Short-term financing lease liabilities, Long-term debt (excluding tower obligations), Long-term debt to affiliates, and Financing lease liabilities less Cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated as follows:\n\nFree Cash Flow - Net cash provided by operating activities less Cash purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less Cash payments for debt prepayment of debt extinguishment costs. Free Cash Flow is utilized by T-Mobile\u2019s management, investors, and analysts to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.\n\nOur guidance range for Free Cash Flow is calculated as follows:\n\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPU and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:\n\nAverage Revenue Per User (ARPU) - Average monthly Service revenues earned from customers. Service revenues for the specified period divided by the average customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period.\n\nBranded postpaid phone ARPU excludes branded postpaid other customers and related revenues.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200206005925/en/\nPress Contact:\nMedia Relations\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nmediarelations@t-mobile.com\nhttp://newsroom.t-mobile.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nNils Paellmann\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\ninvestor.relations@t-mobile.com\nhttp://investor.t-mobile.com\nSource: T-Mobile US, Inc.",

The new anti-robocalling feature is currently rolling out to T-Mobile and Sprint customers and will give customers peace of mind that calls from the Sprint network to the T-Mobile network (and vice versa) are really coming from the number listed on their caller ID display and are not being spoofed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an arms race with these scammers, and we\u2019ve got to join forces as an industry to keep all wireless customers protected,\u201d said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. \u201cWe were first to announce readiness for STIR/SHAKEN, first to implement Caller Verified, and today we lead the industry with the most cross-network STIR/SHAKEN partnerships to keep consumers better protected. T-Mobile will keep innovating and delivering on the frontlines in the battle against unwanted calls, and we won\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201dWhile all carriers compete fiercely in the marketplace, we all agree that the industry-wide plague of robocalls and scammers must be tackled arm-in-arm with other carriers as we put the latest technology to work to help protect our customers,\u201d said Sprint CEO Michel Combes. \u201cSTIR/SHAKEN is one tool among many that Sprint is utilizing in a multi-year anti-robocalling development program to improve our customers\u2019 experience.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile was first to announce readiness for the FCC-recommended STIR/SHAKEN standards in November 2018 and first in the wireless industry to implement STIR/SHAKEN when it launched Caller Verified on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in January 2019. T-Mobile leads the industry in STIR/SHAKEN implementation and now works across four networks: Comcast Xfinity Voice home phone service, AT&T Wireless, Inteliquent and Sprint. As more network providers across the industry implement the standards and more device providers participate, more calls will be verified over time, keeping consumers better protected.\n\nAs part of today\u2019s news, T-Mobile also announced that Caller Verified is now operable across 23 smartphones, with more coming soon. Customers with these devices and the latest software update will automatically see \u201cCaller Verified\u201d on their screens for non-spoofed calls from the T-Mobile and Sprint networks.\n\nWith work already underway with additional providers, Sprint\u2019s collaboration with T-Mobile is one of several roll outs of STIR/SHAKEN technology to improve protection from robocalls and scammers for Sprint customers. Sprint also offers customers Sprint Call Screener Basic, a free service that identifies unwanted malicious calls and permits users to block them, and the more feature-rich Sprint Call Screener Plus premium service. In addition to the services provided by the free service, Sprint Call Screen Plus also displays a texter\u2019s name or a caller\u2019s name, city and state, even those not listed in contacts; identifies, blocks, and reports calls that are lower-risk, but still a nuisance; categorizes incoming calls as spam, robocalls or fraud calls; reports an individual phone number as spam; and keeps history of blocked and risky numbers.\n\nThe FCC has recommended STIR/SHAKEN standards to digitally ensure that a call is in fact from the number displayed on Caller ID. The acronym stands for Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) and Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using toKENs (SHAKEN). STIR/SHAKEN, along with other tools such as the use of reasonable analytics, is key to the battle against unwanted robocalls and fraud.\n\nFor more information on all the ways T-Mobile is protecting customers, visit https://www.t-mobile.com/resources/call-protection.\n\nFor Metro by T-Mobile customers, more information is available at https://www.metropcs.com/shop/services/protection.\n\nFor more information on how Sprint is protecting customers, visit: https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/services/screener.html?INTNAV=Newsroom:CallScreener\n\n# # #\n\nQualifying service and capable device required.\n\nAbout T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAs America's Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc.

This year we came to play in the Super Bowl!\u201d said John Legere, T-Mobile CEO. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t think of a better combo than this hilarious real-life mother/son duo to share the story of our 5G network. Only T-Mobile has nationwide 5G. Go tell your mama!\u201d\n\nLast year, T-Mobile launched America\u2019s first \u2014 and still only \u2014 nationwide 5G network. The Un-carrier\u2019s 5G network covers more than 1 million square miles and reaches over 200 million people. Unlike Verizon 5G that can get blocked by walls, windows, people and even an umbrella and covers spotty patches of outdoor areas in just 34 cities, T-Mobile 5G provides far reaching coverage that can go through walls and works indoors and out in more than 5,000 cities and towns. And in parts of seven urban areas, T-Mobile has millimeter wave 5G for speedy, hotspot-like coverage outdoors.\n\nIf T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint closes, the New T-Mobile will have the ability to build on this foundation by adding critical mid-band spectrum for far-reaching coverage and performance as well as additional millimeter wave spectrum for blazing-fast speeds in dense urban areas. Only this combination will deliver a 5G network with both coverage breadth and depth of performance.\n\nFor more information on T-Mobile\u2019s 5G, visit www.T-Mobile.com/coverage.\n\nCredits:\nCreative: Panay Films\nDirector: Steve Pink\n\n# # #\n\nNO PURCHASE NECESSARY.

        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Jan 24, 2020 9:07AM EST",
        "content": "\nWhat\u2019s the news: Ahead of Super Bowl LIV, T-Mobile amped its 5G in Miami, adding millimeter wave to its low-band 5G, and rolled out permanent network improvements across the city to get ready for the big game.\n\nWhy it matters: Nearly 150,000 football fans will come to Miami ready to share and stream every special moment. Residents and visitors will benefit from the permanent enhancements long after the big game ends.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Everyone who lives in or visits Miami \u2026 for the Super Bowl and beyond.\n    MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nAs pro football gets set to crown its latest champion, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) has put the final touches on its network in Miami to make sure customers have an incredible mobile experience. Over the last year, T-Mobile permanently boosted network capacity at venues throughout Miami so customers can share their game day moments in real time. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers already have the biggest 5G network in Miami. And now, customers with capable 5G smartphones can get a speed boost from millimeter wave 5G in places like Hard Rock Stadium and Bayfront Park.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200124005268/en/(Photo: Business Wire)\n\u201cAll these network upgrades mean T-Mobile customers in and around the city can snap, share and stream from the big game with great coverage and serious speed,\u201d said Neville Ray, President of Technology at T-Mobile. \u201cAnd long after the Super Bowl has come and gone, T-Mobile customers will continue to have the biggest 5G footprint in Miami and across the rest of America with the ONLY nationwide 5G network. And we\u2019re just getting started! If the merger with Sprint is approved, we\u2019ll build on this 5G foundation to deliver transformational broad and deep 5G for all.\u201d\n\nWith 150,000 people predicted to travel to Miami for Super Bowl LIV events, T-Mobile focused network enhancements where the biggest crowds will be, including Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Beach Convention Center, Bayfront Park, Miami Beach and Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports. And almost all the updates are permanent, so Miami residents and visitors can enjoy the improvements long after the Super Bowl is over.\n\nT-Mobile more than doubled LTE capacity at Hard Rock Stadium so customers can stream, tweet, post and chat about every big moment from the game. To enhance indoor capacity at key venues throughout Miami, T-Mobile built new distributed antenna systems (DAS) and deployed small cells throughout the city to provide additional performance boosts in places that can be difficult for towers to reach.\n\nAlmost all of Miami is covered with T-Mobile\u2019s far reaching low-band 5G and fast LTE, so whether customers watch the game from the couch or the beach they\u2019ll be ready to share the action. In addition to launching broad 5G coverage last month, T-Mobile has newly deployed millimeter wave 5G for customers with capable smartphones in parts of Miami, including nearly all of Bayfront Park and at Hard Rock Stadium in the lower bowl, parking lot and main entrances.\n\nTo ensure customers with compatible smartphones know where they can access 5G in Miami, T-Mobile has an interactive map of its nationwide low-band 5G to show where coverage is available down to the neighborhood level and created new millimeter wave maps for the city.\n\nOnly T-Mobile has a nationwide 5G network that works for more people in more places. The Un-carrier\u2019s 5G network covers more than 1 million square miles, with much of that in rural America. This foundational layer of 5G provides far reaching coverage that can travel into buildings and work indoors and out. And now, the Un-carrier has millimeter wave 5G deployed in parts of seven cities for speedy, hotspot-like coverage outdoors in dense urban areas.\n\nIf T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint closes, the New T-Mobile will have the ability to build on this foundation by adding critical mid-band spectrum for far reaching coverage and performance as well as additional millimeter wave spectrum for blazing fast speeds in dense urban areas. Only this combination of low, mid and high spectrum will deliver a 5G network with both coverage breadth and depth of performance. T-Mobile expects devices capable of tapping into low, mid and high band spectrum to become available this year and expects to launch more than 15 new 5G smartphones in 2020 with a variety of price points and features.\n\nFor more information about T-Mobile's network, visit https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage.\n\n# # #\n\n5G: Capable device required; coverage not available in some areas.

With the launch of these 5G-capable superphones, the transformative wireless technology becomes a reality today for the 200 million people in 5,000+ cities and towns from Maine to Florida to California to Hawaii, more than 1 million square miles in total.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191206005261/en/The Kotzatoskis, America's first family to get nationwide 5G, snag a selfie with the new OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren in the T-Mobile store in Lititz, PA. (Photo: Business Wire)\nThat the nation\u2019s first family of 5G hails from the Lancaster area \u2014 the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country and home to one of America\u2019s oldest Amish settlements \u2014 is indicative of T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network strategy. Together with Sprint, the New T-Mobile plans to bring 5G to All wireless customers, not just those in high-density urban areas. If the merger with Sprint moves forward, the New T-Mobile will be able to build on T-Mobile\u2019s broad 5G foundation, adding critical depth. Only this combination will deliver a 5G network with both breadth and depth, something the other guys simply cannot do as quickly.\n\n\u201cTo be a part of history is really exciting. Nationwide 5G only launches once, and we\u2019re the very first! That\u2019s so cool!\u201d said Chandra Kotzatoski. Added Eric Kotzatoski, \u201cBoth my son and I are huge gamers, and our family loves technology. We want the latest and greatest. Always. That\u2019s why it\u2019s exciting T-Mobile is bringing 5G to places like Central PA and not just the big cities. We can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s next!\u201d\n\n#5GFlexContest\n\nAmerica only gets its first nationwide 5G network once, so to say this is a *moment* for early adopters is an understatement. Customers who buy a 5G superphone between now and December 22nd will have the opportunity to \u201cflex\u201d their 5G status on social media with #5GFlexContest, and when they tag a friend, they\u2019ll enter to win a FREE OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren smartphone. Even more extra, all those 5G OGs out there can use photo backgrounds and props to level-up their 5G flexing in select T-Mobile stores.\n\n5G for All\n\nThe very heart of wireless service is based on spectrum, invisible highways in the atmosphere that transport voice and data from a phone to a cell tower. This first nationwide 5G rollout from T-Mobile is based on a spectrum band called 600 MHz, also referred to as low-band spectrum. It provides the foundational layer for T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network.\n\nIn the coming months and years, T-Mobile will build upon this foundational 5G layer to add capacity, or more \u201clanes\u201d using the invisible highway analogy, for greater speeds and better coverage. T-Mobile\u2019s proposed merger with Sprint, if approved, will provide the combined company with critical mid-band spectrum it needs to increase capacity and performance even more. Only a combination of low, mid and high-band spectrum will deliver a 5G network with both breadth and depth covering all of America, something that T-Mobile and Sprint simply cannot do alone. The stakes are high for the U.S., as billions in economic growth and jobs are expected to come from 5G and the innovations it will unleash.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s 5G network is not just bigger, it\u2019s better. Here\u2019s how: \n\nTo celebrate the launch of nationwide 5G, customers who switch to T-Mobile can get the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren for FREE with 24 monthly bill credits when they trade in an eligible phone.

With clear 600 MHz spectrum reserved for 5G, T-Mobile is uniquely positioned to deliver 5G that covers more people in more places. Together with Sprint, the New T-Mobile has even bigger plans to supercharge 5G, with a broad and deep network for all Americans.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Early adopters looking for a cost effective 5G phone that will work indoors and out, across the country.\n    BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nIt\u2019s on! T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) today lit up the country\u2019s first nationwide 5G network, covering more than 200 million people and more than 5,000 cities and towns all across the country. Today\u2019s launch immediately catapults T-Mobile into the leadership position as the country\u2019s biggest 5G network, covering more than 1 million square miles, much of that in rural America. But today is just the start. If the merger with Sprint closes, the New T-Mobile will be able to build on this foundation to deliver transformational broad and deep 5G for All.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191202005562/en/T-Mobile 5G: It\u2019s On! America\u2019s First Nationwide 5G Network Is Here. (Graphic: Business Wire)\nT-Mobile execs have fun lighting up America\u2019s first nationwide 5G network\n\nTwo new 5G superphones, the exclusive OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren and the Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G, are available for pre-order today at www.t-mobile.com/devices/5g-phones and in T-Mobile stores on December 6. Both 5G superphones tap into the Un-carrier\u2019s 600 MHz 5G network where available and T-Mobile\u2019s advanced nationwide LTE network elsewhere. Plus, both are ready to use Sprint\u2019s 5G spectrum (2.5 GHz) when available from the New T-Mobile if the merger closes. To celebrate the launch, customers can get the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren for FREE with 24 bill credits when they switch to T-Mobile and trade in an eligible phone \u2026 or, get a Note10+ 5G for FREE with 24 bill credits when they buy another and add a line (two for new customers).\n\nMetro by T-Mobile will launch America\u2019s first nationwide prepaid 5G on December 6. Because what good is advanced technology if not everyone \u2014 absolutely everyone \u2014 can get it?\n\n\u201c5G is here on a nationwide scale. This is a HUGE step towards 5G for All,\u201d said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. \u201cWhile Dumb and Dumber focus on 5G for the (wealthy) Few, launching in just a handful of cities \u2014 and forcing customers into their most expensive plans to get 5G \u2014 we\u2019re committed to building broad, deep nationwide 5G that people and businesses can access at no extra cost with the New T-Mobile \u2026 and today is just the start of that journey.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s 5G network is not just bigger, it\u2019s better. Here\u2019s how:\n\n\u201cThe carriers have been over-hyping 5G for years now, setting expectations beyond what they can deliver. When Verizon says #5GBuiltRight, they must mean sparse, expensive and limited to outdoors only,\u201d said Neville Ray, T-Mobile President of Technology. \u201cMeanwhile at T-Mobile, we built 5G that works for more people in more places, and this is just the start. With the New T-Mobile, we\u2019ll see 5G speeds follow the same path as LTE, increasing exponentially over time. Plus, real broad and deep 5G will unleash whole new categories of innovation that will touch almost every area of the economy. The 5G future is bright, and it starts today.\u201d\n\nOf course, T-Mobile has published an interactive, zoomable 5G map at www.t-mobile.com/5Gmap, so customers can see exactly where they\u2019ll get 5G coverage, down to their neighborhoods. For months (231 days, to be exact), Verizon refused to publish 5G coverage maps, until the Un-carrier forced them to do so with a relentless VerHIDEzon.com campaign aimed at ensuring greater carrier transparency.\n\nT-Mobile is starting by building a 5G foundation with broad nationwide access for more people in more places. Together with Sprint, the New T-Mobile will have the ability to complete the picture, adding critical depth with mid-band spectrum for broad coverage and performance as well as millimeter wave spectrum for hotspot-like coverage in dense urban areas. Only this combination will deliver a 5G network with both breadth and depth, something the carriers simply cannot do as quickly.\n\n5G Superphones\n\nThe Un-carrier isn\u2019t holding back when it comes to making 5G more accessible and affordable. Next year, T-Mobile expects to launch more than 15 new 5G smartphones with a variety of price points and features. For those ready to get 5G now, customers who switch to T-Mobile can get the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren for FREE with 24 monthly bill credits when they trade in an eligible phone. Existing customers can get up to $300 off the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren or up to HALF off the Galaxy Note10+ 5G via trade-in credit and rebate when they trade in their eligible phone. Plus, customers with good credit can get a free Note10+ 5G with 36 monthly bill credits when they buy one and add a line (two for new customers).\n\nOnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren\n\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren device is exclusive to T-Mobile customers and sports a 6.67\u201d Fluid QHD+ Display with a 90 Hz refresh rate. It comes packed with three rear cameras, a 4085 mAh battery and Warp Charge 30T. In collaboration with McLaren, the device focuses on innovation and premium design with papaya orange accents. T-Mobile customers can get the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren in 256GB in Papaya Orange for $37.50/month ($0 down, FRP: $899.99) \u2014 all for well qualified customers for 24 months on T-Mobile\u2019s no-interest Equipment Installment Plan.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 5G touts a 6.8\u201d Cinematic Infinity display, four rear cameras and a 4300 mAh battery. It comes equipped with an enhanced S Pen and Wireless PowerShare capabilities. T-Mobile customers can get the Galaxy Note10+ 5G in 256GB in Aura Glow or Aura Black for $36.12/month ($0 down, FRP: $1,299.99) \u2014 all for well qualified customers for 36 months on T-Mobile\u2019s no-interest Equipment Installment Plan.\n\nFor more information on the latest 5G devices at T-Mobile, visit www.t-mobile.com/devices/5g-phones.

        "title": "T-Mobile, Comcast and Inteliquent Deliver Industry First in War Against Illegal Call Spoofing",
        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Nov 21, 2019 9:00AM EST",
        "content": "    BELLEVUE, Wash. & PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) and Inteliquent, Inc. today announced they\u2019ve achieved an industry first in the war against spoofers and scammers, completing the first end-to-end STIR/SHAKEN call verification across three networks. T-Mobile and Comcast announced STIR/SHAKEN interoperability earlier this year, giving consumers with a growing number of capable smartphones peace of mind that calls from Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Voice phones to T-Mobile phones (and vice versa) are not generated by a scammer spoofing a number. Now, calls can be routed through Inteliquent as well as directly between T-Mobile and the Xfinity Voice landline phone service and still ensure that the number displayed has been verified. With this technical first, our companies are expanding what is possible with STIR/SHAKEN, not only enabling peer-to-peer call verification but also connections via tandem networks.\n\nNeighbor spoofing \u2014 where scammers hijack a phone number to match the area code and 3-digit prefix of the person they\u2019re targeting \u2014 is a common scam. People are more prone to answer calls from numbers that look familiar, putting them at risk of falling victim to fraudsters. Today\u2019s news means consumers are more protected against these types of spoofed calls.\n\n\u201cScammers and spoofers are a scourge on the industry, and at T-Mobile, we\u2019re using every tool available to fight against these bad guys on behalf of consumers,\u201d said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. \u201cWe were first to announce STIR/SHAKEN readiness, first to implement caller verification, and first to launch cross-network caller verification \u2026 we continue to be on the front lines to keep Un-carrier customers protected, and we won\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers are tired of getting scammed, and Comcast has developed ways to ensure Xfinity customers know the calls they are answering are legitimate,\u201d said Tony Werner, President of Technology, Product and Xperience for Comcast. \u201cThis is another milestone in our efforts to implement STIR/SHAKEN. We were one of the first companies to conduct a non-lab exchange of a verified call and we co-authored many of the core STIR and SHAKEN specifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe communications industry is committed to stopping call spoofing, which seriously harms consumers,\u201d stated Surendra Saboo, Inteliquent\u2019s President. \u201cInteliquent fully supports the FCC\u2019s recent STIR/SHAKEN initiative, and we\u2019re excited about our new collaboration with T-Mobile and Comcast. Together, we can prevent scammers from connecting with citizens.\u201d\n\nSTIR (Secure Telephony Identity Revisited) and SHAKEN (Secure Handling of Asserted information using toKENs) standards are recommended by the FCC to identify authentic calls on networks. T-Mobile and Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Voice were the first to deliver network interoperability in April 2019. Comcast has implemented STIR/SHAKEN for all Xfinity Voice home phone subscribers, authenticating outgoing residential calls and validating incoming authenticated calls.\n\nAs part of today\u2019s news, T-Mobile also announced that Caller Verified, the Un-carrier\u2019s implementation of STIR/SHAKEN, is now operable across 17 smartphones, with more coming soon. Caller Verified is live today for all T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers, and customers with these devices and the latest software update will automatically see \u201cCaller Verified\u201d on their screen for authentic calls from the T-Mobile network and Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Voice home phone service.\n\nFor more information on all the ways T-Mobile is protecting customers, visit https://www.t-mobile.com/resources/call-protection.\n\nFor Metro by T-Mobile customers, more information is available at https://www.metropcs.com/shop/services/protection.\n\nFor additional information about what Comcast is doing to fight robocalls, visit corporate.comcast.com.\n\nCapable device required.\n\nAbout T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nAs America's Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc.
