This is the latest product to join the ranks of successful innovations developed since Starbucks and PepsiCo formed the North American Coffee Partnership (NACP) in 1994, which includes Bottled Cold Brew, Bottled Frappuccino\u00ae chilled coffee drink, Starbucks Tripleshot\u00ae beverages, Starbucks Doubleshot\u00ae beverages, Multi-Serve Iced Coffee and more. Over the past 25+ years, the NACP has grown to more than $2 billion in retail sales, and Starbucks is the leader in the RTD coffee category with 82 percent share.\n\n\u201cThrough the NACP, Starbucks and PepsiCo created the RTD Coffee category 25 years ago and have consistently delivered leading innovation to our consumers,\u201d said Nik Dhodi, Starbucks senior director, brand management. \u201cTo build on the success of Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew in our retail cafes and meet the evolving needs of consumers in the category, we are excited to launch a line of RTD Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew beverages to expand the reach to even more people.\u201d\n\nWhile RTD Nitro Cold Brew isn\u2019t new to the marketplace, Starbucks is one of the only coffee companies to bring it to scale, and the brand sees a great opportunity to further expand the RTD Nitro Cold Brew market that is growing at a rate of almost 40% per year.\n\nRTD Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew arrives on the heels of the popular Nitro Cold Brew in Starbucks stores, representing customer-centric innovation for Starbucks. The brand first introduced Nitro Cold Brew at Starbucks Reserve\u00ae Roastery in Seattle in July 2015, and due to popularity, Nitro Cold Brew scaled to 500 U.S. stores less than one year later. Last year, Starbucks reached national availability of Nitro Cold Brew in U.S. company operated stores.\n\nThe new product is available in three flavors, two of which are inspired by handcrafted beverages served at Starbucks stores: Black, Vanilla Sweet Cream and Dark Caramel. The Cold Brew is infused with nitrogen, and the moment the can is opened a rush of microbubbles delivers a delicious, velvety smooth taste. It can be found nationwide for a suggested retail price of $3.99 at convenience locations and $3.49 in grocery.\n\nThe NACP has more caf\u00e9 favorites available in RTD format, including the new Starbucks Iced Latte Caramel Macchiato that brings the fan-favorite flavor available in caf\u00e9s since 1996 to your home or on-the-go. The NACP has also introduced new flavors to various existing product platforms this year, including: Starbucks Frappuccino Brown Butter Caramel with a Splash of Cold Brew, Starbucks Iced Espresso Classics White Chocolate Mocha, Starbucks Tripleshot\u2122 Energy Dark Roast, Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso Americano, Starbucks Medium Roast Subtly Sweet Iced Coffee, and 40 oz.

        "content": "\nQ1 Comparable Store Sales Up 5% Globally, Led by 6% Comp Growth in the U.S. and 3% Comp Growth in China\n\nGlobal Net Store Growth of 6% Versus Prior Year, Led by 16% Net Store Growth in China\n\nGAAP EPS of $0.74; Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79\n\nActive Starbucks\u00ae Rewards Membership in the U.S. Up 16% Year-Over-Year to 18.9 Million\n    SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today reported financial results for its 13-week fiscal first quarter ended December 29, 2019. GAAP results in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include items which are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information.\n\n\u201cBuilding on solid business momentum from fiscal 2019, Starbucks performed very well throughout the first quarter, including one of the strongest holiday seasons in the history of our company. As a result, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2020,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, president and ceo. \u201cOur growth was fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development, as well as continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. Investments in our partners, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships contributed not only to strong topline growth, but also significant margin expansion in the quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur partners are the center of creating a special Starbucks Experience for each and every customer we serve, and I am very grateful for their extraordinary efforts through this holiday quarter. As we begin our fiscal second quarter, I want to acknowledge the dynamic situation our partners in China are navigating as health officials respond to the coronavirus. As events unfold, we will be transparent with all stakeholders in communicating how we are responding to these extraordinary circumstances and the implications for our near-term business results. We remain optimistic and committed to the long-term opportunity in China, building on our brand heritage and 20-year legacy of profitable growth,\u201d concluded Johnson.\n\nQ1 Fiscal 2020 Highlights\n\nQ1 Americas Segment Results\n\nNet revenues for the Americas segment grew 9% over Q1 FY19 to $5.0 billion in Q1 FY20, primarily driven by 6% growth in comparable store sales and 550 net new store openings, or 3% store growth, over the past 12 months.\n\nOperating income grew 13% to $1.1 billion in Q1 FY20, up from $1.0 billion in Q1 FY19. Operating margin of 21.9% expanded 90 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage, supply chain efficiencies and lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits, as well as investments in store labor hours and higher occupancy costs.\n\nQ1 International Segment Results\n\nNet revenues for the International segment grew 4% over Q1 FY19 to $1.6 billion in Q1 FY20, primarily driven by 1,380 net new store openings, or 11% store growth, over the past 12 months and 1% growth in comparable store sales, partially offset by a 5% revenue-dilutive impact of converting certain retail businesses to fully licensed markets.\n\nQ1 FY20 operating income of $275.9 million grew 20% over Q1 FY19 operating income of $230.0 million. Operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to sales leverage, supply chain efficiencies, the impact of the conversions of certain retail businesses to fully licensed markets and lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by product mix shift and strategic investments.\n\nQ1 Channel Development Segment Results\n\nNet revenues for the Channel Development segment declined 2% from Q1 FY19 to $494.6 million in Q1 FY20, primarily due to lapping prior year product sales to Unilever as a result of the sale and transition of the Tazo brand, partially offset by expansion of the Global Coffee Alliance.\n\nOperating income of $175.5 million in Q1 FY20 was flat compared to Q1 FY19. Operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 35.5%, primarily due to the lapping of prior year Nestl\u00e9 transaction costs, distribution efficiencies and favorable business mix shift, partially offset by incremental costs to develop and grow the Global Coffee Alliance.\n\nFiscal 2020 Guidance\n\nThe company's fiscal year 2020 guidance is unchanged from what was provided in conjunction with its Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings report which excludes any impact of the coronavirus.\n\nCurrently, we have closed more than half of our stores in China and continue to monitor and modify the operating hours of all of our stores in the market in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus. This is expected to be temporary. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption, reduced customer traffic and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but are expected to materially affect our International segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. The company will update its guidance for fiscal 2020 when we can reasonably estimate the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nCompany Updates\n\n1. In October, Starbucks announced a $10 million investment in four established Community Development Financial Institutions to drive economic opportunities in Chicago. The investment is expected to finance more than 500 small business loans focused on supporting entrepreneurs in Chicago's underserved communities.\n\n2. In November, Starbucks opened its first-ever Starbucks\u00ae Pickup store in New York City's Penn Plaza. This unique location is designed for customers on-the-go and uses Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay as the primary ordering and payment method.\n\n3. In November, Starbucks announced a new flexible benefits program for its partners in China known as Flex Star Benefits. The program empowers partners to make individual benefits selections based on what they need from a variety of options designed to help partners enrich themselves, provide better care for loved ones, or make a positive difference to their communities.\n\n4. In November, Starbucks announced that it will eliminate single-use plastic straws from nearly 1,500 stores across Japan starting in January 2020. The change will introduce new paper straws made of responsibly-sourced paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae and will eliminate an estimated 200 million single-use plastic straws annually from Starbucks stores in Japan.\n\n5. The company repurchased 13.0 million shares of common stock in Q1 fiscal 2020; approximately 16.2 million shares remain available for purchase under the current authorization.\n\n6. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share, payable on February 21, 2020, to shareholders of record as of February 6, 2020.\n\nConference Call\n\nStarbucks will hold a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, which will be hosted by Kevin Johnson, president and ceo, and Patrick Grismer, cfo. The call will be webcast and can be accessed at http://investor.starbucks.com. A replay of the webcast will be available until end of day Thursday, February 27, 2020.\n\nAbout Starbucks\n\nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.

The company is unable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because the company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures.

The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s GAAP financial results.\n\nSupplemental Information\n\nThe following supplemental information is provided for historical and comparative purposes.\n\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\n\nIn addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS are general and administrative expenses, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.\n\nNon-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\n\u00a0\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200128005762/en/\nStarbucks Contact, Investor Relations:\nDurga Doraisamy\n206-318-7118\ninvestorrelations@starbucks.com\n\nStarbucks Contact, Media:\nReggie Borges\n206-318-7100\npress@starbucks.com\nSource: Starbucks Corporation",

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\u201cAs we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, we are looking ahead with a heightened sense of urgency and conviction that we must challenge ourselves, think bigger and do much more in partnership with others to take care of the planet we share,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe company\u2019s aspiration is to become resource positive \u2013 storing more carbon than it emits, eliminating waste, and providing more clean, freshwater than it uses. \u201cThis aspiration is grounded in Starbucks mission,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBy embracing a longer-term economic, equitable and planetary value for our company, we will create greater value for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nA comprehensive, data-driven environmental footprint of carbon emissions, water use and waste in Starbucks global operations and supply chain informed the five strategies to prioritize work:\n\nJohnson also outlined three preliminary targets for 2030:\n\nOn Starbucks 50th anniversary in 2021, the company will formalize its 2030 environmental goals based on learnings between now and then. Specifically, Johnson noted, the coming year will involve comprehensive market research and trials to better understand consumer behavior and incentives to encourage more use of reusable containers.\n\nJohnson noted the importance of Starbucks partnerships with others on its journey to be a more sustainable company. Advisors to the company have provided the following comments:\n\nSheila Bonini, Senior Vice President, Private Sector Engagement, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), said: \u201cAs the global climate crisis is fueling a new set of challenges for the planet, Starbucks has set an ambitious vision to give more than they take from our planet\u2019s finite natural resources. This is exactly the kind of leadership we need to see from businesses\u2014an opportunity to invest in their own future while making their global customer base a partner in this sustainability journey.\u201d\n\nWilliam McDonough, CEO, McDonough Innovation, said: \u201cI am inspired by Starbucks resource positive goals because commerce is the engine of change and these goals allow us, with constant humility, to create authentic Environmental, Social and Governance value. These goals also encourage us to innovate toward the dream of Cradle to Cradle: A delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, water, soil and power \u2013 economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed. Imagine\u2026have a cup of coffee and the world gets a little bit better.\u201d\n\nSander Defruyt, Lead of the New Plastics Economy initiative at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said: \u201cThe New Plastics Economy Global Commitment unites businesses, governments and others behind a clear vision for a world where plastic never becomes waste or pollution, and the ambitious targets required to achieve it. Creating this circular economy for plastic will be a challenging journey, but by signing the Global Commitment, Starbucks is joining forces with more than 450 signatories to make it possible. We urge others to join them. By coming together, we can eliminate the plastics we don\u2019t need and innovate, so the plastics we do need can be safely and easily circulated, keeping them in the economy and out of the environment.\u201d\n\nMark Lee, Executive Director, SustainAbility, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see Starbucks embrace a data-driven and team-driven approach to creating a resource positive future. Given their proven ability to tap into the passion and expertise of their partners around the globe, I am confident that they will succeed and that this will have a huge impact. Starbucks sustainability commitment is deeply embedded in their enterprise-wide strategies and in the hearts and minds of their leaders. Their most senior leadership was directly involved in the creation of this plan, and they did an outstanding job convening experts in the field in the course of its development, inviting them to help Starbucks dream big on what's possible for the planet. This puts Starbucks in the vanguard of corporate sustainability leaders, and we hope more businesses will be inspired to develop similarly robust approaches to addressing the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.\"\n\nDr. M. Sanjayan, CEO, Conservation International, said: \u201cThis pledge to become \u2018resource positive\u2019 is bold and necessary \u2013 exactly what I\u2019ve come to expect from Starbucks. For more than two decades, Conservation International has partnered with Starbucks to source coffee in ways that are good for people and the planet. Today, 99 percent of Starbucks coffee is verified as ethically sourced \u2013 but we have not rested. Now we are working to bring the entire coffee sector along to make coffee the world\u2019s first sustainable agricultural product. This is what it will take to meet today\u2019s challenges: bold vision paired with action that does not rest.\u201d\n\nConrad MacKerron, Senior Vice President, As You Sow, said: \u201cAs You Sow and Trillium Asset Management applaud Starbucks commitment to undertake extensive research and testing on consumer behavior and ways to dramatically increase utilization of reusable beverage containers, and to set a new reusables goal within one year.

We\u2019ve learned a great deal from our 14 Community Stores and applied those learnings to how we approach community partnership in more than 8,000 neighborhoods we serve across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Community Stores will share several common aspects compared to other Starbucks cafes, including: locations in economically distressed communities; a designated room or space for community events and programming; a partnership with a local United Way chapter to facilitate relevant community programs; a focus on working with diverse contractors for store construction and remodels; and an emphasis on hiring locally.\n\nSince launching the Community Store initiative in 2015, Starbucks has opened 14 stores across the country in Jamaica Queens, NY; Ferguson, MO; Phoenix, AZ; Englewood in the southside of Chicago; east Baltimore; Long Beach, CA; Trenton, NJ; White Center in south Seattle; Miami Gardens, FL; Birmingham, AL; Redbird in Dallas, TX; Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, NY; New Orleans, LA; and Jonesboro, GA. The 15th store will open in Prince George\u2019s County, MD this spring.\n\nStarbucks estimates its Community Stores have helped:\n\nTo scale the program to 100 locations by 2025, Starbucks will focus on supporting store remodels in addition to new development projects.\n\nAs part of Starbucks national partnership with United Way, local United Ways and 211s in targeted communities will work with Community Store partners to create resources and programs for each community from life skills training for youth to mentorship programs and beyond. That includes facilitating activities at the stores that support people in the community, providing Starbucks partners with customized community profiles and resource information and connecting partners with volunteer activities that help create real change in the communities in which they live and work.\n\n\u201cUnited Way and Starbucks share a commitment to ensuring every person has the opportunity to thrive, and we\u2019re honored to partner with them,\u201d said Suzanne McCormick, U.S. President of United Way Worldwide. \u201cUnited Way has been connecting people to resources across the U.S. for more than 130 years, and we look forward to deploying United Way\u2019s local expertise and experience to help Starbucks Community Stores make a real difference.\u201d\n\nThe Starbucks Foundation Awards 1,000 Neighborhood Grants, Thousands of Starbucks Partners Volunteer in National Service Projects \n\nIn addition to today\u2019s news of the Community Store expansion, The Starbucks Foundation also announced it has awarded more than 1,000 Neighborhood Grants, a new giving program that creates local impact and empowers store partners to strengthen relationships with local nonprofit organizations. To date, hundreds of store managers have secured more than $1 million in grants from The Starbucks Foundation for more than 1,000 local nonprofit organizations in all 50 U.S. states and all Canadian provinces.\n\nIn addition to these local partnerships initiated by Starbucks partners every day, thousands of store partners have committed to hundreds of local service projects next week across the United States as part of the Martin Luther King Week of Good. In many communities, United Way is facilitating volunteer activities that help improve education, health and financial stability.\n\nTo learn more about how our partners are creating meaningful connections and driving positive impact in their communities, visit stories.starbucks.com/stories/partners.\n\nAbout Starbucks \n\nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\u201cOver the past five years, we have created the ultimate immersive experience around all-things-coffee in spectacular Starbucks Reserve Roasteries in flagship cities around the world. This week we are delighted to open our doors on the sixth global Roastery in an iconic building located on Chicago\u2019s renowned Magnificent Mile,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, Starbucks ceo. \u201cThese Roasteries amplify the Starbucks brand, serve as innovation hubs, and create experiences for millions of customers around the world.\u201d\n\nStarbucks has a rich history with the Windy City, dating back to 1987 when the company opened its first store outside of the Pacific Northwest and had a total of 11 retail stores and served as the foundation for the company\u2019s national growth strategy. Nearly 32 years later, there are 796 company-operated stores in the region where Starbucks employs more than 18,100 partners (employees). The Roastery employs nearly 200 people, including roasters, baristas, commessas, bakers, and mixologists.\n\n\u201cThe design of the Chicago Roastery was inspired by the iconic Chicago landmark, and the city itself,\u201d said Jill Enomoto, vice president of Roastery Design & Concept for Starbucks. \u201cWe embraced the building\u2019s natural light, married it with shades of classic Starbucks greens and intentionally wove in design features to encourage customer exploration and highlight the love and respect we have for coffee.\u201d\n\nThe Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago is a working coffee roastery where Starbucks Roasters will be small-batch roasting Starbucks rarest single-origin coffees and blends called Starbucks Reserve. The coffee roasted in Chicago will be served exclusively to visitors of the location, available in handcrafted beverages as well as freshly scooped whole bean coffee.\n\nUnique Food and Beverage Experiences \n\nCoffee Bars\n\nThere are three main coffee bars at the Roastery, which in total offer seven brewing methods, including espresso, pour over, coffee press, siphon, Chemex\u00ae, Clover\u00ae and cold brewing.\n\nNitrogen Gelato\n\nThe Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago is the only Starbucks location in the U.S. to offer on-demand liquid nitrogen gelato. Designed to pair with Starbucks Reserve\u00ae coffee, nitrogen gelato is mixed by hand, with every scoop made right on the spot and offers another way for customers to enjoy specialty Starbucks Reserve coffees. Nitrogen gelato previously debuted at the Milan Roastery when it opened in September 2018.\n\nArriviamo\u2122 Cocktail Bar\n\nThe Chicago Roastery will feature a dedicated Arriviamo\u2122 Bar, like the Starbucks Reserve Roastery locations in New York and Milan. Inspired by the Italian tradition of apertivo, the Arriviamo Bar will be a destination for customers looking for a carefully crafted cocktail. Located on the fourth floor, the Arriviamo\u2122 bar features an assortment of traditional and unique cocktails, all concepted by local mixologists Julia Momose, Annie Beebe-Tron and Rachel Miller. In addition to a menu of classic cocktails and a selection of local Chicago beer and wine, exclusive specialty cocktails featuring Starbucks Reserve coffee and tea that nod to the culture and traditions of Chicago include:\n\nPrinci\n\nIn addition to coffee beverages, Roastery visitors can enjoy food at Princi\u2122, the renowned artisanal boutique bakery and cafe founded by Italian baker Rocco Princi. As the exclusive food purveyor at Starbucks Reserve locations, Princi offers on-site baking of fresh breads, cornetti and focaccia, pizza and salads, plus cakes and tarts. A full menu of items will be available on the second floor Princi bakery, while select items will also be available throughout the Roastery for customers looking to pair their coffee with a savory or sweet bite.\n\nExclusive to the Chicago Roastery will be a bakery conveyor that has been designed by Starbucks to transport fresh baked goods from the Princi bakery on the second floor, to the Starbucks Reserve Coffee Bar on the main level.\n\nLocal Collaborations\n\nIn a nod to the city\u2019s vibrant history, artwork from local Chicago artists that tell stories and encourage customers to explore can be found throughout the building\u2019s five floors. Customers can also purchase limited-edition merchandise from Chicago-based visual artist Mac Blackout to take home with them.\n\nCreating a Positive Impact \n\nTo further show support for city of Chicago, Starbucks recently announced an investment of $10 million into four established Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) to drive economic opportunity in the city. The investment, dispersed among Accion Chicago, Chicago Community Loan Fund, Local Initiative Support Corporation and IFF, is expected to generate more than 500 loans toward supporting Chicago\u2019s small businesses, community development projects, and the economic vitality of the city\u2019s underserved neighborhoods.\n\nThe Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago opens on November 15 at 9 a.m. For more information, visit www.StarbucksReserve.com or follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/starbucksreserve/\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191112006093/en/\nStarbucks Coffee Company\npress@starbucks.com\n206-318-7100\nSource: Starbucks Coffee Company",

Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2019, as we sustained positive momentum across each of our business segments,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, president and ceo. \u201cOur U.S. business delivered 6% comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter, while China grew comparable store sales by 5% and total transactions by 13%. Our strong performance throughout fiscal 2019 gives us confidence in a robust operating outlook for fiscal 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are making meaningful progress against our strategic priorities while streamlining the company, bringing more focus and discipline to everything we do. The investments we are making for the long term---in our partners, our stores, beverage innovation and digital---are collectively delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience, as evidenced by all-time-high customer connection scores in the fourth quarter. This long-term focus is instrumental to how we are building an enduring company,\u201d concluded Johnson.\n\nQ4 Fiscal 2019 Highlights\n\nFull Year Fiscal 2019 Highlights\n\nFiscal 2019 Re-segmentation\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company realigned its operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of its streamlining efforts. Specifically, the previous China/Asia Pacific (\"CAP\") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") segment have been combined into one International segment. The company will continue to provide supplemental information on its two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China, in its quarterly earnings news releases in accordance with its \"Growth at Scale\" agenda.\n\nConcurrently, results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks ReserveTM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which was previously included within Corporate and Other, is now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations.\n\nFurther, to better support the review of its results, the company changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of company-operated store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. The company also made certain other immaterial changes. These reclassifications have been retrospectively applied.\n\nThere was no impact to consolidated net revenues, consolidated operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes.\n\nConcurrent with the change in reportable segments and reclassification of certain operating expenses noted above, the company revised its prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation.\n\nRestated GAAP and non-GAAP quarterly financial information for FY18 and FY19 (through fiscal Q3) can be found on the Supplemental Financial Data page of our Investor Relations website (http://investor.starbucks.com).\n\nQ4 Americas Segment Results\n\nNet revenues for the Americas segment grew 9% over Q4 FY18 to $4.7 billion in Q4 FY19, primarily driven by 6% growth in comparable store sales, 607 net new store openings, or 3% store growth, over the past 12 months, and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting for stored value card (SVC) breakage.\n\nOperating income grew 5% to $938.9 million in Q4 FY19, up from $890.8 million in Q4 FY18. Operating margin of 20.2% declined 70 basis points, primarily due to the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience, growth in wages and benefits and increased investments in labor hours, partially offset by cost savings initiatives and sales leverage.\n\nNet revenues for the International segment grew 6% over Q4 FY18 to $1.6 billion in Q4 FY19, primarily driven by 1,337 net new store openings, or 11% store growth, over the past 12 months, and a 3% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by a 5% revenue-dilutive impact of converting certain retail businesses to fully licensed markets.\n\nQ4 FY19 operating income of $262.7 million grew 18% over Q4 FY18 operating income of $222.4 million. Operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 16.7%, primarily due to sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, labor efficiencies and the impact of the conversions of certain retail businesses to fully licensed markets, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits, unfavorable product mix shift and strategic investments.\n\nNet revenues for the Channel Development segment declined 6% from Q4 FY18 to $508.1 million in Q4 FY19, primarily due to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl\u00e9 following the close of the transaction on August 26, 2018.\n\nOperating income of $190.9 million in Q4 FY19 was flat compared to Q4 FY18. Operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 37.6%, primarily due to lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance, including business taxes associated with the up-front payment and employee-related costs. This favorability was partially offset by the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl\u00e9 and the sale of our Tazo brand.\n\nFiscal 2020 Guidance\n\nThe company introduces the following fiscal year 2020 guidance (all growth targets are relative to fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP measures unless specified):\n\nPlease refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release.\n\nThe company will provide additional information regarding its business outlook during its regularly scheduled quarterly earnings conference call; this information will also be available following the call on the company's website at http://investor.starbucks.com.\n\nCompany Updates\n\n1. In July, Starbucks opened its first Starbucks NowTM store in Beijing, China. The new express store format integrates Starbucks store environment with the company's Mobile Order & Pay technology and Starbucks\u00ae Delivers into one seamless and convenient experience for customers.\n\n2. In September, Starbucks hosted over 12,000 store managers and field operations leaders at its largest ever Leadership Experience. The three-day conference held in Chicago was designed to help strengthen leadership capabilities and solidify the foundation of an enduring company.\n\n3. In September, Starbucks welcomed three new appointees to its Board of Directors: Richard E. Allison, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of Domino's; Andrew Campion, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Nike; and Isabel Ge Mahe, Apple's Vice President and Managing Director of Greater China. These appointments increased Starbucks board of directors to 13 members.\n\n4. The company repurchased 23.5 million shares of common stock in Q4 fiscal 2019; approximately 29.2 million shares remain available for purchase under the current authorization.\n\n5. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share, an increase of 14%, payable on November 29, 2019, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2019.\n\nConference Call\n\nStarbucks will hold a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, which will be hosted by Kevin Johnson, president and ceo, and Patrick Grismer, cfo. The call and selected presentation materials will be webcast and can be accessed at http://investor.starbucks.com.

        "content": "\nThe investment in community lenders Accion Chicago, Chicago Community Loan Fund, IFF and Local Initiatives Support Corporation will finance more than 500 loans focused on supporting Chicagoland entrepreneurs in underserved communities\n    CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nToday, Starbucks Coffee Company announced its plans to invest $10 million in four community lenders to drive economic opportunity in Chicago. Starbucks investment is expected to help finance more than 500 loans to foster growth in small business, support community development projects and create more jobs in Chicago\u2019s underserved communities.\n\n\u201cWe believe the pursuit of profit is not in conflict with the pursuit of doing good,\u201d said Starbucks ceo Kevin Johnson. \u201cWe know that our business performs at its best when the communities we serve are thriving. This sustained investment will provide borrowers who often face barriers with access to capital and mentorship to grow their business and create more jobs in Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI applaud Starbucks for their commitment of corporate citizenship and efforts to strengthen the communities in which they serve,\u201d said Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. \u201cChicago\u2019s own relationship with Starbucks stretches over three decades, and we are incredibly excited to continue that partnership well into the future, through the 200 new jobs created in the beautiful new Reserve Roastery, as well as across our neighborhoods that aligns to our new INVEST South/West initiative, as we work together to create jobs, drive investment, and expand access to opportunity for every one of our city\u2019s residents and families.\u201d\n\nThe $10 million investment from Starbucks is planned to be dispersed among Accion Chicago, Chicago Community Loan Fund (CCLF), Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC) and IFF \u2013 four established Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) that drive economic opportunity in the city\u2019s neighborhoods, especially within those with little access to the flexible, affordable capital that entrepreneurs need. In addition to lending, the organizations will provide borrowers with mentoring and technical assistance to ensure the success of their projects.\n\n\u201cOur communities are filled with talent and entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d said Meghan Harte, executive director of LISC Chicago, which has invested more than $970M in grants, loans and equity throughout Chicago. \u201cWhat they often lack is access to the right kind of capital so that entrepreneurs can launch, build and grow. With this investment, Starbucks is supporting a broadly shared prosperity that will deliver clear benefits to residents, while making our neighborhoods safer and stronger.\u201d\n\nWith more than 150+ combined years of experience providing capital and financial guidance, these CDFIs have the financial expertise and local knowledge of Chicago to support meaningful, sustainable impact. Areas of focus for loan disbursement will include small businesses, nonprofit organizations and commercial real estate ventures.\n\n\u201cOFN commends Starbucks for this investment in small business and job creation for the Chicago communities that need it most,\u201d said Amir Kirkwood, chief lending and investment officer for Opportunity Finance Network (OFN). \u201cThis welcome investment will be managed by four CDFIs who are OFN members, all expert in providing much-needed fair and responsible lending to small businesses to create economic opportunity where it really counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chicago Community Loan Fund has been working strategically to create more commercial retail in low-income neighborhoods for a number of years,\u201d stated Bob Tucker, Chief Operating Officer of CCLF. \u201cWith this influx of capital from Starbucks, CCLF will leverage additional funding to help address Chicago\u2019s loss of population in these communities and create not only access to quality goods and services, but needed jobs for local residents.\u201d\n\nThis investment follows Starbucks Create Jobs for USA initiative in partnership with the OFN in 2011. The program was dedicated to creating and sustaining jobs in underserved communities throughout the U.S. bolstered by a $5 million contribution from the Starbucks Foundation. In three years, it raised more than $15 million in donations, which participating CDFIs turned into $105 million in financing for businesses to create or retain more than 5,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cAccion provides the capital, coaching and connections that neighborhood entrepreneurs need to create jobs and wealth in underserved communities. In Chicago, entrepreneurs of color and women entrepreneurs need services that traditional financial institutions often can\u2019t provide,\u201d said Brad McConnell, CEO of Accion Chicago. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do, and that\u2019s why partnerships with thoughtful organizations like Starbucks are so crucial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIFF is thrilled that a partner like Starbucks is seeing the communities of Chicago as wellsprings of opportunity,\u201d said Matthew Roth, President Core Business Solutions, IFF. \u201cBy making an investment - one that expects to be repaid - Starbucks is betting that our communities can transform their dreams and aspirations into financial and social return.\u201d\n\nBank of America will assist Starbucks in deploying the investment to each of the four lenders. The CDFIs are expected to start making loans to small business owners and community organizations by early next year, although borrowers can apply for a loan now. Chicagoland residents can learn more and apply for loans by visiting the respective CDFI websites.\n\nThis news comes weeks ahead of the opening the Starbucks Reserve\u00ae Roastery on Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile.\n\nAbout Starbucks\n\nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.
