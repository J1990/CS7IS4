        "content": "SAN CARLOS, Calif., Feb.  25, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Check Point Software Technologies today announced it has been named a Microsoft Security 20/20 award winner for the Most Prolific Integration Partner category. The company was honored among a global field of top Microsoft partners for demonstrating excellence in innovation, integration, and customer implementation with Microsoft technology.At the inaugural Microsoft Security 20/20 partner awards, held February 23, Microsoft announced award winners in 16 categories that span security integration partners, system integrators and managed security service providers. Check Point Software Technologies is a winner for Microsoft Security 20/20 Most Prolific Partner award.Today, the cloud computing environment is the most complex it has ever been. The number of cloud services offered to enterprises has grown exponentially. The manner in which businesses store and scale data has changed dramatically. At the same time, the number of technologies deployable in the cloud has multiplied significantly, while application architecture has moved to micro-services, which has redefined the perimeter for security to that of the workload. All of these changes have made for a drastic increase in attack surface in today\u2019s cloud computing environment. Enterprises everywhere face the stern reality of multiple attack points - both ephemeral in nature and fragmented across a vast landscape in the cloud.To meet the unique security needs of today\u2019s cloud and that of Azure customers, Microsoft and Check Point began working together. Microsoft shares Check Point\u2019s belief that prevention supersedes detection. That, if you\u2019ve detected an attack - most likely in the form of a breach - it means that you are already undergoing damage control to your company and brand. As a result, multiple integrations connect Microsoft and Check Point CloudGuard security products, including Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel and Intune. These integrations ensure the assets of Azure customers are fully protected while allowing them to benefit from the elastic, dynamic and cost effective nature of Azure cloud.Azure customers are choosing Check Point as their top choice in cloud security. Microsoft\u2019s Most Prolific Integration Partner Award underscores Check Point\u2019s leadership and vision in cloud security, and further emphasizes Check Point\u2019s ability to meet the new and complex nature that surrounds today\u2019s cloud.\u201cMicrosoft and Check Point have significantly aligned their efforts,\u201d said Itai Greenberg, VP, Product Management and Product Marketing Check Point Software Technologies. \u201cSecurity is continually cited as a key barrier to wide-spread enterprise cloud adoption and expansion. Together, Microsoft and Check Point deliver one of the most advanced threat prevention solution to Azure customers, keeping their cloud network, data and applications protected from the most sophisticated Gen VI cyberattacks today.\u201dOnly through collaborations can organizations help customers get clarity and become more secure. The security ecosystem must work together to create a vision for the future where people, information, and companies are made safer. Microsoft Security 20/20 provides an opportunity to honor Microsoft partners that have developed and delivered exceptional Microsoft-based solutions and services during the past year.Deployed by over 4,000 organizations worldwide, the Check Point CloudGuard portfolio of cloud security solutions addresses all aspects of the Cloud threat landscape. The solution delivers public and private cloud advanced threat prevention, posture management and compliance, runtime protection for cloud workloads, SaaS application security, as well as cloud threat intelligence and analytics.Follow Check Point via:Twitter:\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/checkpointswFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/checkpointsoftwareBlog: http://blog.checkpoint.com YouTube:\u00a0http://www.youtube.com/user/CPGlobalLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/check-point-software-technologiesAbout Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

        "content": "VIENNA, Austria, Feb.  05, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPX \u2013 Check Point Research, the Threat Intelligence arm of Check Point\u00ae Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally, has today revealed vulnerabilities that would enable a hacker to deliver ransomware or other malware to business and home networks by taking over smart lightbulbs and their controller.Check Point\u2019s researchers showed how a threat actor could exploit an IoT network (smart lightbulbs and their control bridge) to launch attacks on conventional computer networks in homes, businesses or even smart cities.\u00a0 Researchers focused on the market-leading Philips Hue smart bulbs and bridge, and found vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-6007) that enabled them to infiltrate networks using a remote exploit in the ZigBee low-power wireless protocol that is used to control a wide range of IoT devices.In an analysis of the security of ZigBee-controlled smart lightbulbs that was published in 2017, researchers were able to take control of a Hue lightbulb on a network, install malicious firmware on it and propagate to other adjacent lightbulb networks. Using this remaining vulnerability, our researchers decided to take this prior work one step further and used the Hue lightbulb as a platform to take over the bulbs\u2019 control bridge and ultimately, attacking the target's computer network. It should be noted that more recent hardware generations of Hue lightbulbs do not have the exploited vulnerability.The attack scenario is as follows:\u201cMany of us are aware that IoT devices can pose a security risk, but this research shows how even the most mundane, seemingly \u2018dumb\u2019 devices such as lightbulbs can be exploited by hackers and used to take over networks, or plant malware,\u201d said Yaniv Balmas, Head of Cyber Research, Check Point Research. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that organizations and individuals protect themselves against these possible attacks by updating their devices with the latest patches and separating them from other machines on their networks, to limit the possible spread of malware. In today\u2019s complex fifth-generation attack landscape, we cannot afford to overlook the security of anything that is connected to our networks.\u201dThe research, which was done with the help of the Check Point Institute for Information Security (CPIIS) in Tel Aviv University, was disclosed to Philips and Signify (owner of the Philips Hue brand) in November 2019. Signify confirmed the existence of the vulnerability in their product, and issued a patched firmware version (Firmware 1935144040) which is now \u00a0via an automatic update. We recommend users to make sure that their product received the automatic update of this firmware version.\u201cWe are committed to protecting our users\u2019 privacy and do everything to make our products safe. We are thankful for responsible disclosure and collaboration from Checkpoint, it has allowed us to develop and deploy the necessary patches to avoid any consumers being put at risk,\u201d says George Yianni, Head of Technology Philips Hue.Here is a demo video of how the attack works. The full technical research details will be published at a later date in order to give users time to successfully patch their vulnerable devices.Check Point is the first vendor to provide a consolidated security solution that hardens and protects the firmware of IoT devices. Utilizing a recently acquired technology, Check Point allows organization to mitigate device level attacks before devices are compromised utilizing on-device run time protection.Follow Check Point Research via:Blog: https://research.checkpoint.com/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/_cpresearch_About Check Point Research Check Point Research provides leading cyber threat intelligence to Check Point Software customers and the greater intelligence community.

We also published new findings about malware families including multiple types of Ransomware, malware on computers and mobile devices.Vulnerabilities in Applications & InfrastructureWeb Conferencing Vulnerabilities Have you ever wondered if someone can eavesdrop on your company\u2019s meetings and learn the details of your biggest secrets? Imagine a stranger sitting just next to you in the same room, when you are discussing your \u201cnext big thing.\u201d In this publication we describe a technique which would have allowed a threat actor to perform exactly that type of attack over the Zoom web conferencing platform.Don\u2019t be silly, it\u2019s only a lightbulb After analyzing the security of ZigBee IoT devices, specifically the smart hub that bridges between the IP and Zigbee network. By masquerading as a legitimate Zigbee lightbulb, Check Point Research was able to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the bridge that enabled them to infiltrate the IP network using a remote over-the-air ZigBee exploit.AzureStack SSRF to Info Disclosure Check Point Research discovered major flaws in Microsoft's popular cloud platform that is intended to poke a hole in the (false) security concept provided by the cloud providers.Vulnerabilities in TikTok Our research revealed multiple vulnerabilities in TikTok. The research found that an attacker could send a spoofed SMS message to a user containing a malicious link and that Tiktok's subdomain https://ads.tiktok.com was vulnerable to XSS attacks. These vulnerabilities could have allowed an attacker to manipulate content on a user\u2019s account and even extract confidential personal information saved on these accounts.WhatsApp Crash & Data Loss Bug Check Point Research found a vulnerability in WhatsApp that could allow an attacker to deliver a malicious group chat message that would crash the app and cause data loss. To regain use of WhatsApp, users would need to uninstall and reinstall it, then delete the group which contains the message.Vulnerabilities in Android Applications Discovered that multiple applications on the Google Play store, including Facebook, are vulnerable to very old vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to steal data related to the app and gain Android permissions which the app has access to such as a user\u2019s location.Ransomware ResearchDeCypherIT To evade detection, malware developers use packers to encrypt their malicious crafts before releasing them to the wild. Check Point Research discusses a case study where they were able to decrypt a specific packer that is very popular among malware developers. The developers of this packer offer it for sale on the internet, and promise it is undetectable.Incident Response Casefile \u2013 A successful BEC leveraging lookalike domains Cyber criminals hacked a wire transfer between a Chinese venture capital firm and an Israeli startup. After the criminals hijacked a one million dollar wire transaction, Check Point's Incidence Response Team investigated the case.Phorpiex botnet The Phorpiex botnet is spread through exploit kits and with the help of other malware, has infected more than 1,000,000 Windows computers. The annual criminal revenue generated by Phorpiex botnet is approximately half a million US dollars.In the Footsteps of a Sextortion Campaign Check Point Research exposed a spam botnet, dubbed Phorpiex, which is responsible for a large portion of the sextortion traffic seen in the wild. We monitored the operation and recorded Bitcoin transfers to the Phorpiex campaign wallets whose current value is over $110,000.Eye on the Nile-a cyber-operation Check Point\u2019s research team uncovered an operation against civil rights activists, as well as Amnesty members in Egypt.

Emotet is primarily used as a distributor of ransomware or other malicious campaigns.December also saw a significant increase in attempts to exploit the \u2018Command Injection Over HTTP\u2019 vulnerability, with 33% of organizations globally being targeted.\u00a0 This vulnerability rose from being the 5th most exploited in November to the top position last month. If successfully exploited, the payload was a DDoS botnet:\u00a0 the malicious file used in the attack also contained a number of links to payloads exploiting vulnerabilities in several IoT devices from manufacturers including D-Link, Huawei and RealTek, with the aim of recruiting these devices into botnets.\u201cOver the past three months, the threats impacting most organizations have been versatile, multi-purpose malware like Emotet and xHelper. These give cyber-criminals multiple options for monetizing attacks, as they can be used for distributing ransomware or spreading further spam campaigns,\u201d said Maya Horowitz, Director, Threat Intelligence & Research, Products at Check Point. \u201cThe aim for criminals is to get a foothold in as many organizations and devices as possible, so that subsequent attacks can be more lucrative and damaging.\u00a0 So it\u2019s critical that organizations educate their employees about the risks of opening email attachments, downloading resources or clicking on links that do not come from a trusted source or contact.\u201dDecember 2019\u2019s Top 3 \u2018Most Wanted\u2019 Malware:*The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month.Emotet impacted 13% of organizations globally in December, up from 9% in November.

        "content": "SAN CARLOS, Calif., Jan.  08, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Check Point Research, the Threat Intelligence arm of Check Point\u00ae Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally, revealed today that it uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in TikTok that could have allowed attacks to manipulate content on user accounts and even extract confidential personal information saved on these accounts.TikTok is used mainly by teenagers and kids that use this app to share, save and keep private (and sometimes very sensitive) videos of themselves and their loved ones. The research found that an attacker could send a spoofed SMS message to a user containing a malicious link. When the user clicked on the malicious link, the attacker was able to get a hold of the TikTok account and manipulate its content by deleting videos, uploading unauthorized videos, and making private or \"hidden\" videos public.The research also found that Tiktok's subdomain https://ads.tiktok.com was vulnerable to XSS attacks, a type of attack in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. Check Point researchers leveraged this vulnerability to retrieve personal information saved on user accounts including private email addresses and birthdates.Check Point Research informed TikTok developers of the vulnerabilities exposed in this research and a fix was responsibly deployed to ensure its users can safely continue using the TikTok app.\u201cData is pervasive but data breaches are becoming an epidemic, and our latest research shows that the most popular apps are still at risk,\u201d said Oded Vanunu, Check Point\u2019s Head of Product Vulnerability Research. \u201cSocial media applications are highly targeted for vulnerabilities as they provide a good source for private data and offer a good attack surface gate.\u00a0Malicious actors are spending large amounts of money and putting in great effort to penetrate into such huge applications. Yet most users are under the assumption that they are protected by the app they are using.\u201dLuke Deshotels, PhD, TikTok Security Team: \u201cTikTok is committed to protecting user data. Like many organizations, we encourage responsible security researchers to privately disclose zero day vulnerabilities to us. Before public disclosure, CheckPoint agreed that all reported issues were patched in the latest version of our app. We hope that this successful resolution will encourage future collaboration with security researchers.\"Available in over 150 markets, used in 75 languages globally, and with over 1 billion users, TikTok is definitely one of the most downloaded apps around. As of October 2019, TikTok is the most downloaded app in the United States, making it the first Chinese app to have achieved such a record.More information on the research is available on the Check Point Research blog.Follow Check Point Research via:Blog: https://research.checkpoint.com/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/_cpresearch_About Check Point Research Check Point Research provides leading cyber threat intelligence to Check Point Software customers and the greater intelligence community.

        "date": "Dec 17, 2019 6:00AM EST",
        "content": "SAN CARLOS, Calif., Dec.  17, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Check Point Research, the Threat Intelligence arm of\u00a0Check Point\u00ae Software Technologies Ltd.\u00a0(NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally, recently helped mitigate a new vulnerability in WhatsApp that could allow a bad actor to deliver a malicious group chat message that would crash the app for all members of the group. To regain use of WhatsApp, users would need to uninstall and reinstall it, then delete the group which contains the message.To create the malicious message that would impact a WhatsApp group, the bad actor would need to be a member of the target group (WhatsApp allows up to 256 users per group). From there, the bad actor would need to use WhatsApp Web and their web browser\u2019s debugging tool to edit specific message parameters and send the edited text to the group. This edited message would cause a crash loop for group members, denying users access to all WhatsApp functions until they reinstall WhatsApp and delete the group with the malicious message.Oded Vanunu, Check Point\u2019s Head of Product Vulnerability Research said: \u201cBecause WhatsApp is one of the world\u2019s leading communication channels for consumers, businesses and government agencies, the ability to stop people using WhatsApp and delete valuable information from group chats is a powerful weapon for bad actors. All WhatsApp users should update to the latest version of the app to protect themselves against this possible attack.\u201d\u00a0Check Point Research responsibly disclosed its findings to the WhatsApp bug bounty program on August 28th, 2019. WhatsApp acknowledged the findings and developed a fix to resolve the issue, which is available since WhatsApp version number 2.19.58.\u00a0 Users should manually apply on their devices. \u201cWhatsApp responded quickly and responsibly to deploy the mitigation against exploitation of this vulnerability,\u201d said Oded Vanunu.\u201cWhatsApp greatly values the work of the technology community to help us maintain strong security for our users globally,\u201d said WhatsApp Software Engineer Ehren Kret. \u201cThanks to the responsible submission from Check Point to our bug bounty program, we quickly resolved this issue for all WhatsApp apps in mid-September. We have also recently added new controls to prevent people from being added to unwanted groups to avoid communication with untrusted parties all together.\u201dThe Check Point Research team found the vulnerability by inspecting the communications between WhatsApp and WhatsApp Web, the web version of the app which mirrors all messages sent and received from the user\u2019s phone. This enabled researchers to see the parameters used for WhatsApp communications and manipulate them. This new research builds on the 'FakesApp' flaws discovered by Check Point Research, which allowed group chat messages to be edited to spread fake news.\u00a0WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users and more than a billion groups, making it the most popular instant messaging app worldwide. Over 65 billion messages are sent via WhatsApp per day.Watch the\u00a0demo video\u00a0of how the attack works, and read the full technical details in our research report\u00a0here.Follow Check Point Research via: Blog:\u00a0https://research.checkpoint.com/ Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/_cpresearchAbout Check Point Research Check Point Research provides leading cyber threat intelligence to Check Point Software customers and the greater intelligence community.

        "content": "SAN CARLOS, Calif., Dec.  11, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Check Point Research, the Threat Intelligence arm of Check Point\u00ae Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally, has published its latest Global Threat Index for November 2019.\u00a0The research team reported that for the first time in over three years, a mobile trojan has entered the overall top malware listing as well as being the most prevalent mobile threat over the past month.The mobile trojan is xHelper, which was first seen in the wild in March 2019. xHelper is a multi-purpose trojan targeting Android users that can download other malicious applications as well as display malicious advertisements.\u00a0 It is also reported to be a persistent application, able to reinstall itself even if it is uninstalled by the victim. During the past six months the malware\u2019s code has been constantly updated, helping it to evade mobile antivirus solutions and to keep on infecting new victims. As a result, it has entered the overall top 10 malware list at #8.\u00a0November\u2019s most wanted malware was the Emotet botnet, retaining the #1 position from October.\u00a0 However, in November, it impacted 9% of organizations globally, down from 14% the previous month.\u201cBoth Emotet and xHelper are versatile, multi-purpose malware that can be adapted to criminals\u2019 needs, such as distributing ransomware, spreading spam campaigns or distributing malvertising to users\u2019 devices.\u00a0 This shows that criminals are trying multiple different illicit tactics to monetize their operations, rather than following a single trend like cryptomining which dominated the sector in 2018,\u201d said Maya Horowitz, Director, Threat Intelligence & Research, Products at Check Point. \u201cAs such, it\u2019s essential that organizations deploy the latest generation anti-malware solutions on their networks as well as on employees\u2019 mobile devices, to protect all enterprise endpoints. They should also educate employees about the dangers of opening email attachments, downloading resources or clicking on links that do not come from a trusted source or contact.\u201dNovember 2019\u2019s Top 3 \u2018Most Wanted\u2019 Malware:*The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month.Emotet has maintained its position at the top of the malware list with a global impact of 9%. XMRig was the second most popular malware impacting 7% of organizations worldwide, followed by Trickbot, impacting 6% of organizations globally.November\u2019s Top 3 \u2018Most Wanted\u2019 Mobile Malware:This month xHelper - a new entry to our top malware list \u2013 was the most prevalent mobile malware, followed by Guerilla and Lotoor.November\u2019s \u2018Most Exploited\u2019 vulnerabilities:This month the three top exploited remained the same as in the previous month \u2013 SQL injection techniques continue to lead the list, impacting 39% of organizations globally, followed by the OpenSSL TLS DTLS Heartbeat Information Disclosure vulnerability and MVPower DVR Remote Code Execution - impacting 34% and 33% of organizations worldwide respectively.Check Point\u2019s Global Threat Impact Index and its ThreatCloud Map is powered by Check Point\u2019s ThreatCloud intelligence, the largest collaborative network to fight cybercrime which delivers threat data and attack trends from a global network of threat sensors.

(NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading provider of cyber security solutions globally, has extended the capabilities of its CloudGuard cloud security platform to support Kubernetes computing services, including Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). CloudGuard also delivers additional security capabilities for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Serverless computing solutions, including AWS Lambda and related services like AWS Fargate, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Kinesis.With the recent acquisition of Protego \u2013 a company providing serverless security - Check Point further delivers on its vision of ensuring consistent and complete security for any enterprise workload in any cloud.In a 2019 survey, 87% of respondents were running container technologies, up from 55% in 2017. Serverless is the fastest-growing extended cloud service, with 50% growth over 2018. However, rapid adoption of these technologies can create challenges for organizations in getting visibility of, and enforcing consistent security and compliance across their cloud deployments. This increases the risk of misconfigurations and security holes which expose organizations to the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.With CloudGuard, customers can ensure that their Kubernetes configurations continuously comply with established container security baselines such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks or NIST 800-190. This new functionality complements CloudGuard\u2019s existing ability to secure traffic between Kubernetes and on premise or cloud assets using IPsec VPN. CloudGuard\u2019s new Serverless Code Scanning feature detects, alerts on and remediates security and compliance risks in a Serverless environment. \u00a0\u201cNo matter which cloud resources organizations choose, it\u2019s critical that they have complete visibility and control over them to meet Cloud workload protection (CWPP) and Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) requirements,\u201d said Zohar Alon, Head of Cloud Products at Check Point. \u201cThese enhancements to CloudGuard, including the recent acquisition of Protego, deliver powerful CSPM and CWPP capabilities across enterprises\u2019 entire cloud deployments, continuously analyzing, detecting any misconfigurations or security issues, and remediating them. This ensures organizations can fully exploit the cloud\u2019s agility without compromising their security posture.\u201dCheck Point is a Platinum Sponsor of AWS re:Invent 2019 in Las Vegas between December 2-6.
