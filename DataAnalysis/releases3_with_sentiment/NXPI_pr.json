        "content": "EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands, March  01, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) today provided an update to its first quarter 2020 revenue guidance due to potential impacts from the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID 19\u201d).\u201cSubsequent to our earnings call on February 3rd, we now believe that our expectations for total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 will be reduced due to the impact of the coronavirus,\u201d said Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer. \u201cGetting our arms around the actual business impact of the virus has been a challenge given the fluid and dynamic situation, but we want to stress that the most important thing at this stage is the health and safety of all our NXP team members and their families. From a business perspective, the impact is very much an estimate at this time, based on business trends over the last several weeks post the Lunar New Year holiday. What we have seen is lower than expected sell-through and order push outs in both our distribution channel and with direct customers. While we have not seen any material order cancellations, we currently expect the impact to revenue in the first quarter to be in the range of $50 million to $150 million. At the lower end of this range, the $50 million impact is what we\u2019ve actually seen so far, with the weakness most pronounced in the weeks after the Lunar New Year holiday, however, we have now seen more normal order levels in the last two weeks. The $150 million upper range is estimated on a scenario where we would see a return of weakness in the coming weeks, like what we saw right after Lunar New Year. We need to stress that these assumptions are based on less than perfect data, as the situation in China continues to be highly fluid.\u201dConference Call and Webcast InformationNXP will host a conference call on Monday, March 2, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Central European Time) to address questions analyst and investor questions.Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1 \u2013 888 \u2013 603 \u2013 7644 (within the U.S.) or 1 \u2013 484 \u2013 747 - 6631 (outside of the U.S.).

        "content": "EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands, Feb.  03, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, ended December 31, 2019.\u201cNXP delivered full-year revenue of $8.88 billion, a decline of 6 percent year-on-year, against a very challenging semiconductor industry backdrop. As we look forward to 2020, we are increasingly confident that the demand trends within our end markets are beginning to moderately improve.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the operating environment we experienced in 2019, NXP drove improved profitability, strong free cash flow generation, and continued to successfully execute our strategy within our target markets. During 2019, we returned $1.76 billion to our shareholders.\u00a0 Over the course of the year, we significantly enhanced our product portfolio. We successfully acquired the Marvell wireless connectivity assets, and introduced new, innovative products and solutions. Our customers have already begun to adopt many of these new solutions, and as they continue to ramp into volume production, we anticipate new products will help to underpin NXP\u2019s long-term growth,\u00a0financial and capital return targets,\u201d said Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer.Key HighlightsSummary of Reported Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2019 ($ millions, unaudited) (1)1.\u00a0 \u00a0Additional Information for the Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2019:Guidance for the First Quarter 2020: ($ millions) (1)Note (1) Additional Information:NXP has based the guidance included in this release on judgments and estimates that management believes are reasonable given its assessment of historical trends and other information reasonably available as of the date of this release. Please note, the guidance included in this release consists of predictions only, and is subject to a wide range of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond NXP's control. The guidance included in this release should not be regarded as representations by NXP that the estimated results will be achieved. Actual results may vary materially from the guidance we provide today. In relation to the use of non-GAAP financial information see the note regarding \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. For the factors, risks, and uncertainties to which judgments, estimates and forward-looking statements generally are subject see the note regarding \"Forward-looking Statements.\" We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including the guidance set forth herein, to reflect future events or circumstances.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn managing NXP's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these\u00a0non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company\u2019s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP\u2019s business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP's underlying performance.\u00a0 This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance,and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management.These non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of these and other similar items in NXP\u2019s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.\u00a0 Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial statements portion of this release in a schedule entitled \u201cFinancial Reconciliation of GAAP to\u00a0non-GAAP Results (unaudited).\u201d Please refer to the NXP Historic Financial Model file found on the Financial Information page of the Investor Relations section of our website at https://investors.nxp.com for additional information related to our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as the impact of these measures on the presentation of NXP's operations.In addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), NXP also provides the following selected financial measures on a non-GAAP basis: (i)\u00a0Gross profit, (ii)\u00a0Gross margin, (iii)\u00a0Research and development, (iv)\u00a0Selling, general and administrative, (v)\u00a0Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, (vi) Other income, (vii)\u00a0Operating income (loss), (viii)\u00a0Operating margin, (ix)\u00a0Financial Income (expense), (x)\u00a0adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, and (xi)\u00a0free cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of Revenue. The non-GAAP information excludes the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, the purchase accounting effect on inventory and property, plant and equipment, merger related costs (including integration costs), certain items related to divestitures,\u00a0share-based compensation expense, restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash interest expense on convertible notes, extinguishment of debt, and foreign exchange gains and losses.Conference Call and Webcast InformationNXP will host a conference call on February 4, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Central European Time) to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and provide an outlook for the first quarter of 2020.Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1 \u2013 888 \u2013 603 \u2013 7644 (within the U.S.) or 1 \u2013 484 \u2013 747 - 6631 (outside of the U.S.).

(NASDAQ: NXPI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2019, ended September 29, 2019.\u201cNXP delivered revenue of $2.3 billion for the third quarter. With sales near the high-end of our guidance and good expense control, we successfully delivered improved operating profitability above the high-end of our guidance range. Additionally, during the quarter we returned $79 million to our shareholders, for a total of $6.6 billion returned to shareholders\u00a0since July 2018. Looking forward, we continue to believe that our product portfolio investments are addressing our customers\u2019 long-term requirements, while in the short-term the global demand environment appears to have stabilized, but the intermediate demand environment continues to be uncertain, and has not markedly improved.\u201d said Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer.Key HighlightsSummary of Reported Third Quarter 2019 ($ millions, unaudited) (1)1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional Information for the Third Quarter 2019:Guidance for the Fourth Quarter 2019: ($ millions) (1)Note (1) Additional Information:NXP has based the guidance included in this release on judgments and estimates that management believes are reasonable given its assessment of historical trends and other information reasonably available as of the date of this release. Please note, the guidance included in this release consists of predictions only, and is subject to a wide range of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond NXP's control. The guidance included in this release should not be regarded as representations by NXP that the estimated results will be achieved. Actual results may vary materially from the guidance we provide today. In relation to the use of non-GAAP financial information see the note regarding \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. For the factors, risks, and uncertainties to which judgments, estimates and forward-looking statements generally are subject see the note regarding \"Forward-looking Statements.\" We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including the guidance set forth herein, to reflect future events or circumstances.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn managing NXP's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company\u2019s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP\u2019s business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP's underlying performance.\u00a0 This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance,and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management.These non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: NXPI), the world\u2019s largest provider of automotive semiconductors1, is pleased to announce the rollout of its life-saving RoadLINK\u00ae V2X communication solution in the new Volkswagen Golf. The recently released Golf of the 8th generation is the first volume European car model equipped with V2X, offering a major boost to the deployment of the technology on European roads and beyond. The technology can prevent accidents by having cars communicate with each other, independent of car brands and without the support of cellular infrastructure.\u201cRoad safety forms the core of VW\u2019s commitment to its customers. As a high-volume manufacturer we aim to be a pioneer in this space,\u201d said Dr. Johannes Neft, Head of Vehicle Body Development for the Volkswagen brand. \u201cThe introduction of V2X, together with traffic infrastructure providers and other vehicle manufacturers, is a major milestone in this direction. Volkswagen includes this technology, which doesn\u2019t involve any user fees, as a standard feature to accelerate V2X penetration in Europe.\u201d\u201cVolkswagen has taken a bold step to seize the road safety initiative through the implementation of V2X,\u201d said Torsten Lehman, senior vice president and general manager of Driver Assistance and Infotainment at NXP. \u201cAfter proving our technology in more than one million test days globally, we are pleased that our RoadLINK technology, developed in cooperation with Cohda Wireless, was chosen to enable new levels of safety in Europe\u2019s most popular car model, the new Golf.\u201dNXP and Volkswagen have closely collaborated for high-reliability and performance, as well as for \u00a0standardization of V2X communication that addresses cybersecurity and privacy protection.A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on the image or link below:SAF 5100: NXP\u2019s RoadLINK\u00ae Solution includes NXP SAF 5100 processors, TEF5100  transceivers and SXF1800 secure element.V2X in EuropeWi-Fi based V2X is a mature technology that has been tested for more than 10 years. Presently,1000 km of European roads are equipped with V2X technology based on Wi-Fi with 5000 km planned through the end of 2019. Its research and development, testing and standardization has occurred within a strong global eco-system of suppliers and car manufacturers to ensure reliability in diverse road and traffic conditions. Wi-Fi therefore forms the basis of the European standard that has been chosen for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. An additional benefit is its availability independent of paid cellular services. Other developing cellular based technologies can be added complementary to Wi-Fi-based V2X.V2X communication is set to become a critical part of advanced driving assistance systems and the migration to autonomous cars that communicate with each other and with traffic infrastructure. The unique benefit of Wi-Fi-based V2X is its robust, low latency, real-time communication \u2013 regardless of any car brands.NXP offers\u00a0the only 5.9 GHz V2X system solution proven in volume production today.Recent V2X Technology NewsNotes:1 Based on Strategy Analytics Sensor Market Growth 2019About NXP Semiconductors NXP Semiconductors N.V.\u00a0enables secure connections for a smarter world, advancing solutions that make lives easier, better, and safer.
