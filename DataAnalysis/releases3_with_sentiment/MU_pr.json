These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically our most recent Form 10-K. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. These certain factors can be found at www.micron.com/certainfactors. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results.Further information regarding Micron\u2019s use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included within this press release.MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions)(Unaudited)MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)(Unaudited)MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES (Unaudited)Property, Plant, and EquipmentWe periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on our assessment of planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates, we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our NAND wafer fabrication facilities and our research and development facilities from five years to seven years as of the beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, we estimate the reduction in non-cash depreciation expense benefited operating income and net income by approximately $74\u00a0million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.Acquisition of Intel's Interests in IMFTOn October 31, 2019, we purchased Intel\u2019s noncontrolling interests in IMFT and IMFT member debt for $1.25\u00a0billion. We recognized a non-operating gain of $72\u00a0million for the difference between the $505 million of cash consideration allocated to the extinguishment of IMFT member debt and its $577\u00a0million carrying value, and a $160\u00a0million adjustment to equity for the difference between the $744\u00a0million of cash consideration allocated to the purchase of Intel\u2019s noncontrolling interest and its $904\u00a0million carrying value.Adoption of Lease Accounting StandardIn the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02 \u2013 Leases (as amended, \u201cASC 842\u201d), which amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of lease payments. In adoption, we applied the modified retrospective method and elected to not recast prior periods. As a result, we recognized $567 million for operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets and reclassified an additional $66\u00a0million of other balances to right-of-use assets to conform to the new presentation requirements of ASC 842.Debt ActivityOn November 18, 2019, we prepaid $519 million of our 2025 Notes and recognized a loss of $18 million in other non-operating income (expense), net. On October 30, 2019, we drew all of the $1.25 billion available under our term loan credit facility. Prior to our acquisition of Intel's interests in IMFT, IMFT repaid Intel $116 million of IMFT member debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts)RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES, ContinuedThe tables above reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP measures of gross margin, operating income, net income attributable to Micron, diluted shares, diluted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and net cash. The non-GAAP adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature, but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. We believe this non-GAAP information is helpful in understanding trends and in analyzing our operating results and earnings. We are providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of our operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate our resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures increase transparency by providing investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling enhanced comparison of our operating results between periods and with peer companies. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from numbers presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. Our management excludes the following items in analyzing our operating results and understanding trends in our earnings:Our outstanding capped call transactions are anti-dilutive in GAAP earnings per share but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of our convertible notes. In periods with non-GAAP income attributable to Micron, non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of capped calls based on the average share price for the period the capped calls are outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted shares are also adjusted for the impact of additional shares resulting from the exclusion of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP income.MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OUTLOOK(In millions, except per share amounts)(1)\u00a0\u00a0 GAAP earnings per share based on approximately 1.13 billion diluted shares and non-GAAP earnings per share based on approximately 1.14 billion diluted shares.The tables above reconcile our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance based on the current outlook. The guidance does not incorporate the impact of any potential business combinations, divestitures, restructuring activities, balance sheet valuation adjustments, strategic investments, financing transactions, and other significant transactions. The timing and impact of such items are dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control.",

        "date": "Nov 12, 2019 9:00AM EST",
        "content": "News Highlights\u00a0BOISE, Idaho, Nov.  12, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today unveiled the world\u2019s highest-capacity industrial microSD card \u2014 Micron\u00ae i300 1TB3 microSDXC UHS-I \u2014 to address the edge storage needs of the video surveillance market and other industrial applications. The new Micron\u00ae i300 1TB microSD card is based on Micron\u2019s advanced 96-layer 3D quad-level cell (QLC) NAND technology, now making it cheaper for small- to medium-sized deployments to have primary storage in the camera compared to a centralized storage architecture. The i300 microSD card enables users of video surveillance systems to capture and store more than three months of high-quality video footage on-device and at the edge.\u201cMicron\u2019s i300 industrial-grade microSD cards for edge storage open the possibility for a broad range of video surveillance as a service deployments that no longer require local network video recorders,\u201d said Amit Gattani, senior director of Segment Marketing in Micron\u2019s Embedded Business Unit. \u201cMicron\u2019s 96-layer 3D QLC NAND is instrumental in helping us deliver 1TB of storage in a microSD form factor and at a breakthrough price point to accelerate edge storage and cloud-based service models.\u201dIntelligence at the EdgeVSaaS systems are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence-based and higher-resolution cameras that require more storage at the edge. The Micron i300 1TB microSDXC card allows 24/7 continuous capture and storage of up to 1TB of high-quality video in the camera. Users of video surveillance systems can now store large amounts of video footage on-device, opening a broader set of uses for cloud-managed solutions.\u201cDemand for commercial surveillance cameras continues to grow at a rapid pace,\u201d said Jeff Janukowicz, research vice president at International Data Corporation (IDC). \u201cSmart cameras, artificial intelligence, machine learning and threat detection are being driven to the edge for real-time responsiveness, making Micron\u2019s 1TB microSD card an invaluable solution for differentiation and innovation.\u201dThe VSaaS market is projected to reach $6 billion in 2022, corresponding to a growth of 22% compound annual growth rate between 2017 and 2022.4 The rising adoption of VSaaS by small to medium businesses and enterprises is attributed to lower overhead costs achieved through ease of installation and elimination of the need for on-site NVRs and DVRs. The ability to store large video footage files in the camera and at the edge reduces the demand for network bandwidth and expenditure associated with continuous cloud storage. These savings contribute to lowering the overall cost of ownership for businesses while bringing flexibility and scalability associated with cloud-based implementation models.\"The video surveillance market is quickly shifting toward hybrid cloud architectures that store video footage on-camera, allowing secure access via cloud-based software,\u201d said Raj Misra, director of Hardware Engineering at Verkada. \u201cEnterprise customers are choosing hybrid cloud offerings to reduce operational costs, simplify installation and management, and gain from powerful video analytics. Micron extending its range of reliable industrial-grade microSD cards to 1TB enables us to provide our customers with industry-leading data retention, security and video resolution options at very cost-effective price points.\"Micron\u2019s industrial-grade microSD portfolio is designed to endure the harsh environments in which surveillance systems are deployed. The Micron i300 1TB microSDXC card minimizes frame drops in a 24/7, 30 frames per second (FPS) recording environment, offering twice the reliability of hard disk drives at 2 million hours mean time to failure. The card features a smart tool for monitoring the health of devices.\u201cVIVOTEK has launched a series of edge-computing network cameras and successfully deployed Micron\u2019s high-quality industrial-grade microSD cards,\u201d said Shengfu Cheng, director of Marketing and Product Development Division, VIVOTEK Inc.\u00a0\u201cMicron\u2019s portfolio of industrial microSD cards up to 1TB equips us to deliver greater flexibility, scalability and maintenance efficiency to our customers, all of which contribute to a better return on investment.\u201dAvailabilityThe Micron i300 microSDXC UHS-I card is offered in 128GB to 1TB capacities, which are available for ordering. The entire industrial-grade portfolio includes capacities ranging from 32GB to 1TB.

The new Micron\u00ae Authenta\u2122 Key Management Service (KMS) platform enables a cloud-first deployment model for a broad set of industrial and automotive applications. It allows installed Authenta-enabled devices to be switched on through a cloud-based service, mitigating some of the biggest challenges and complexities related to securing devices in an \u201ceverything connected\u201d environment.The number of connected IoT devices deployed across markets such as automotive, enterprise, industrial control and connected home is expected to grow from 23 billion in 2019 to 30 billion by 2020.1 Securing these diverse devices remains a concern for system OEMs who want a simple solution that is cost-effective and independent of their choice of system-on-a-chip (SoC) hardware. Authenta KMS, along with its hardware root of trust embedded in NAND and NOR flash devices, equips OEMs to safeguard device functionality at the silicon level.Current methods adopted by the industry for protecting connected devices have their limitations and typically center on one of three common practices: adding secure elements, which is costly and difficult to scale; leveraging secure key injection in the SoC, which creates a fragmented architecture; or simply doing nothing, which puts devices below market and compliance standards.\u201cSecuring a diverse set of IoT edge devices through the complete product lifecycle \u2014 from the supply chain to in-field management \u2014 requires a novel, simple, scalable and cost-effective approach,\u201d said Amit Gattani, senior director of embedded segment marketing for Micron\u2019s Embedded Business Unit. \u201cAuthenta KMS provides a trusted and unique silicon-to-cloud service for all \u2018connected things\u2019 using Authenta-enabled flash devices.\u201dMicron\u2019s Authenta KMS complements existing efforts to protect IoT networks through secure element functions in Authenta-enabled standard flash devices. Authenta KMS security-as-a-service platform allows installed secure flash devices to be activated and managed at the edge through a cloud-based service. This capability enables platform-hardening and device protection through the entire lifecycle, extending from the manufacturing supply chain to in-field installation and management.\u201cThe electronics industry needs to mitigate the growing security concerns from today's fragmented and vulnerable IoT supply chain,\u201d said Tom Katsioulas, board member of the GSA Trusted Supply Chain working group and head of TrustChain operations at Mentor, a Siemens business. \u201cWe are pleased to see Micron's introduction of Authenta Key Management Service, which promises to provide a strong foundation of early provenance and traceability in the supply chain and in the enablement of trusted device services.\u201dAuthenta KMS and applicable software development kits are available to customers today.
