        "content": "    CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nExelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.\n\n\u201cEach of our utilities achieved record-high customer satisfaction in 2019 as we continued to invest in infrastructure to increase reliability and prepare the grid to accommodate more renewable energy, electric vehicles and other technology necessary to meet the challenge of climate change,\u201d said Christopher M. Crane, president and CEO of Exelon. \u201cOur nuclear fleet achieved its highest capacity factor in company history, and our total generation output accounted for about 12 percent of all the carbon-free energy produced in the U.S., avoiding nearly 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. We continued to support the communities we serve last year by volunteering a record-breaking 251,000 hours and donating nearly $52 million to nonprofits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reported another strong year, with full-year adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.22 per share coming in above our revised guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share,\u201d said Joseph Nigro, senior executive vice president and CFO, Exelon. \u201cLast year we invested $5.5 billion in capital at the utilities - or about $150 million more than originally planned - to modernize the electric grid, and we are on track to invest an additional $6.5 billion in the year ahead as we work to provide our customers with more reliable service and help our states meet their environmental goals. With these investments and our continuing focus on reducing costs, we are providing 2020 adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.30 per share.\u201d\n\nFourth Quarter 2019\n\nExelon's GAAP Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $0.79 per share from $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings increased to $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 6.\n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily reflect:\n\nFull Year 2019\n\nExelon's GAAP Net Income increased to $3.01 per share from $2.07 per share in 2018. Exelon's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for 2019 increased to $3.22 per share from $3.12 per share in 2018.\n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the full year 2019 primarily reflect:\n\nOperating Company Results1\n\nComEd\n\nComEd's fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\nPECO\n\nPECO\u2019s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. The favorable impacts of regulatory rate increases were offset by unfavorable weather conditions and volume and higher storm costs.\n\nBGE\n\nBGE\u2019s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income increased to $99 million from $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. BGE\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $101 million from $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to regulatory rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\n____________________\n\n1Exelon\u2019s five business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware; and Generation, which consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities and wholesale and retail customer supply of electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products and risk management services.\n\nPHI\n\nPHI\u2019s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. The favorable impacts of regulatory rate increases were offset by an increase in various expenses. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland and Pepco District of Columbia are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\nGeneration\n\nGeneration had GAAP Net Income of $397 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with a GAAP Net Loss of $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Generation\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $427 million from $221 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher realized energy prices, decreased nuclear outage days, lower operating and maintenance expense and research and development income tax benefits, partially offset by lower capacity prices.\n\nThe proportion of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments as of Dec. 31, 2019, was 91.0% to 94.0% for 2020 and 61.0% to 64.0% for 2021.\n\nInitiates Annual Guidance for 2020\n\nExelon introduced a guidance range for 2020 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $3.00-$3.30 per share.

For all items except the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 ranged from 26.0% to 29.0%. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds were 46.1% and 41.4% for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively; and were 47.3% and 46.2% for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nExelon will discuss fourth quarter 2019 earnings in a one-hour conference call scheduled for today at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Ea\u200bstern Time).\u200b The webcast and associated materials can be accessed at www.exeloncorp.com/investor-relations.\n\nAbout Exelon\n\nExelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) is a Fortune 100 energy company with the largest number of electricity and natural gas customers in the U.S. Exelon does business in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada and had 2019 revenue of $34 billion.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor\u2019s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon\u2019s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies\u2019 presentation. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.

Then, on Oct. 9, 2019, Defendants disclosed that both Exelon and ComEd had received a second grand jury subpoena from the DOJ, now seeking communications with certain individuals and entities, including Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval.

Finally, on Nov. 1, 2019, the Chicago Tribune reported that according to a source with knowledge, Ms. Pramaggiore was one focus of the ongoing federal investigation. According to the same article, ComEd's lobbying investigation dated back to at least mid-May 2019, when the FBI executed search warrants at the homes of former lobbyist Mike McClain of Quincy, a longtime confidant of House Speaker Michael Madigan, and of former 23rd Ward Ald. Michael Zalewski. Additionally, the FBI sought communications among Madigan, McClain and Zalewski about attempts to obtain ComEd lobbying work for Zalewski.

        "content": "\nEDF, which owns a 49.99 percent interest in the three plants, has provided notice that it will exercise its put option to sell its ownership interest to Exelon Generation \n    KENNETT SQUARE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nExelon Generation announced today that EDF is exercising the put option to sell its 49.99 percent interest in the R.E. Ginna, Nine Mile Point and Calvert Cliffs nuclear energy facilities.\n\nAs Exelon has reported in its financial filings, the put option was established in connection with the joint operating services agreement signed by the two companies in April 2014 to enable Exelon Generation to take over operations at the three nuclear plants. Exelon Generation already is the majority owner and operator of the plants, which are located in New York and Maryland. Exelon Generation\u2019s purchase of EDF\u2019s ownership interest will have no impact on plant operations or employees.\n\n\"Since Exelon Generation took over operations, we have created value for both Exelon and EDF by integrating the three plants into the nation\u2019s largest and best-run nuclear fleet. Leveraging the Exelon management model, we\u2019ve improved overall fleet performance and efficiency while reducing costs in a challenging market environment,\u201d said Chris Crane, Exelon President and CEO. \u201cWe have worked collaboratively with EDF leadership as co-owners of these three nuclear plants and look forward to partnering with them in a productive process to purchase their ownership stake.\u201d\n\nAs part of the acquisition process, EDF and Exelon Generation will seek a negotiated agreement on the sale price. If an agreement cannot be reached, the price will be set through a third-party arbitration process to determine fair market value. The transaction will require approval by the New York Public Service Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years or more to complete.\n\nExelon Generation would become the full 100 percent owner of the three zero-carbon nuclear energy facilities, which consist of the single-unit R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (576 megawatts) and the dual-unit Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station (1,907 megawatts), both in upstate New York; and the dual-unit Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (1,756 megawatts) in Maryland.\n\nExelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC), is the nation\u2019s largest producer of carbon-free energy, powering more than 20 million homes and businesses through a diverse generation fleet with more than 31,000 megawatts of capacity. Exelon Generation operates the largest U.S. fleet of zero-carbon nuclear plants with more than 18,700 megawatts from 21 reactors at 12 facilities in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania. It also operates a diverse mix of wind, solar, landfill gas, hydroelectric, natural gas and oil facilities in 19 states with more than 12,300 megawatts.

Ten of the fleet\u2019s 11 reactors ran at nearly 100 percent output levels throughout the week, providing schools, hospitals, businesses and residences the reliable, carbon-free electricity needed to keep heaters running. Dresden Station Unit 2 is currently shut down for a refueling outage.\n\n\"Even during this unseasonably cold weather, our Illinois fleet\u2019s performance further demonstrates the reliability and resiliency of nuclear power in any kind of weather,\u201d said Exelon\u2019s Chief Nuclear Officer Bryan Hanson. \u201cWe are dedicated to being online when customers need us most, no matter what Mother Nature throws at us at any time of year.\u201d\n\nExelon Generation\u2019s Illinois nuclear fleet has proven its mettle time and again during Midwest deep freezes. Throughout record deep freezes earlier this year, the Illinois nuclear fleet operated at 100 percent around the clock. A year prior, the fleet recorded a near-perfect reliability rate, operating 97.6 percent of the time. And during the 2014 Polar Vortex, the plants were critical to meeting electricity demand, as coal piles froze and natural gas supplies were re-routed for home heating.\n\nWinter resiliency and reliability requires year-long planning, preparation and maintenance. Exelon Generation workers spend months ensuring that backup generators and spare equipment is ready for inclement weather. This fall, operators and maintenance personnel inspected freeze protection systems, tested electrical equipment, and properly aligned plant systems to prepare all Exelon Generation facilities for sub-zero temperatures, icy conditions and heavy snowfall. These efforts are in addition to the many equipment upgrades and \"winter readiness\" maintenance activities performed during refueling outages.\n\nExelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC), is the nation\u2019s largest producer of carbon-free energy, powering more than 20 million homes and businesses through a diverse generation fleet with more than 31,000 megawatts of capacity.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191031005232/en/Exelon Third-quarter Earnings Highlights (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\u201cOngoing infrastructure investment at our electric and gas companies is delivering solid financial and customer satisfaction results, while our clean generation fleet continues to achieve best-in-class reliability and operational efficiency,\u201d said Christopher M. Crane, Exelon president and CEO. \u201cExelon was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th consecutive year, ranking in the top 20 percent of North American companies in all industries. We continue to look for ways to meet customer expectations for a cleaner and more resilient energy grid, teaming with the Exelon Foundation to launch a new Climate Change Investment Initiative to fund startups focused on technologies to reduce emissions and advocating for state policies that will properly value nuclear and other clean energy resources.\u201d\n\n\"Our third-quarter performance remained strong, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings of $0.92 cents per share exceeding our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share,\u201d said Joseph Nigro, Exelon\u2019s senior vice president and CFO. \u201cWe are on track to invest more than $5.4 billion at our electric and gas companies by year end to enhance reliability and resiliency. We are also announcing an additional $100 million in annual cost savings at Exelon Generation beginning in 2022, adding to the more than $900 million in companywide cost savings already announced between 2015 and 2018. We are narrowing our guidance range for full-year 2019 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings from $3.00-$3.30 per share to $3.05-$3.20 per share.\u201d\n\nThird Quarter 2019\n\nExelon's GAAP Net Income for the third quarter of 2019 increased to $0.79 per share from $0.76 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings increased to $0.92 per share in the third quarter of 2019 from $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2018. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 4.\n\nThe Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the third quarter of 2019 primarily reflect higher utility earnings due to regulatory rate increases at PECO, BGE and PHI; and, at Generation, decreased nuclear outage days, increased revenue from ZECs in New York and New Jersey, and lower operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by decreased capacity prices and lower realized energy prices.\n\nOperating Company Results1\n\nComEd\n\nComEd's third quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the third quarter of 2018. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\nPECO\n\nPECO\u2019s third quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income increased to $140 million from $126 million in the third quarter of 2018. PECO\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 increased to $141 million from $127 million in the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to regulatory rate increases partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions and volume.\n\nBGE\n\nBGE\u2019s third quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income decreased to $55 million from $63 million in the third quarter of 2018. BGE\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 decreased to $56 million from $64 million compared with the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to an increase in various expenses, partially offset by regulatory rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\nPHI\n\nPHI\u2019s third quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income increased to $189 million from $187 million in the third quarter of 2018. PHI\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 increased to $209 million from $195 million in the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to regulatory rate increases (not reflecting the impact of TCJA). Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland and Pepco District of Columbia are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.\n\nGeneration\n\nGeneration's third quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income increased to $257 million from $234 million in the third quarter of 2018. Generation\u2019s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 increased to $352 million from $318 million in the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to increased revenue from ZECs in New York and New Jersey, decreased nuclear outage days, and lower operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by decreased capacity prices and lower realized energy prices.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2019, the percentage of expected generation hedged is 96%-99%, 84%-87% and 54%-57% for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\n___________\n\n1Exelon\u2019s five business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware; and Generation, which consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities and wholesale and retail customer supply of electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products and risk management services.\n\nRecent Developments and Third Quarter Highlights\n\nGAAP/Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings Reconciliation\n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP Net Income:\n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2018 do not include the following items (after tax) that were included in reported GAAP Net Income:\n\nNote:\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items except the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT fund investments, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 ranged from 26.0% to 29.0%. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT fund investments were 47.1% and 7.7% for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nExelon will discuss third quarter 2019 earnings in a one-hour conference call scheduled for today at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time).

Major investments have included those authorized by the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act (EIMA), or smart grid program, which has modernized and improved the performance of the grid serving 4 million customers. Since 2012, overall reliability has improved more than 60 percent and customers have experienced 45 percent fewer outages on average.EIMA also established a broad range of performance metrics for utilities, including increased spending with diverse suppliers by at least 15 percent over 10 years, which ComEd has far exceeded. ComEd's diverse supplier spend in 2018 was four times the amount spent in 2011.\"Creating opportunities for diverse suppliers to grow and excel is one of the most important roles we play as we continue building a supply chain that reflects the communities we serve,\" said Joe Dominguez, CEO, ComEd.Last year, ComEd added 135 companies to its roster of diverse firms and now works with more than 500 Tier I and Tier II diversity-certified suppliers.

        "date": "Apr 17, 2019 11:18AM EDT",
        "content": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ComEd announced today that it successfully conducted a test proving that the Bronzeville Community Microgrid can keep power flowing in the event of an emergency. The \"simulated islanding\" test checked the resiliency of the microgrid by mimicking events that have the potential to affect power delivery, including major weather events or cyber security or acts of terrorism.As the realities of climate change become more apparent, projects like the Bronzeville Community Microgrid support efforts to integrate additional renewable generation, including wind and solar while enhancing resiliency for communities.Essentially a small power grid with defined boundaries, a microgrid can operate in conjunction with the main grid or disconnect from it and operate in island mode when there's an interruption on the main grid. The set of tests ComEd conducted demonstrated the microgrid's ability to provide power in island mode while drawing upon distributed energy resources (DERs), including battery energy storage and solar photovoltaic PV, to serve customers within the microgrid footprint.\"The Bronzeville microgrid not only demonstrated the value it offers the community when the grid is impacted by a disruptive event, but also in supporting integration of renewable energy,\" said Terence R. Donnelly, president, ComEd. \"This test is an important milestone for ComEd and the Bronzeville community, and numerous supporters in government, academia and industry. We're grateful for the support of an exceptional group of partners, including Illinois Tech, University of Denver, Argonne National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Quanta Technology, SIEMENS, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\"During the test, a portion of ComEd's electric grid operated from distributed energy resources to demonstrate the capability of the microgrid to serve the customers in its footprint. The residences, businesses and public institutions served by this circuit in Bronzeville received power from a locally sited battery energy storage system, solar energy and mobile generation. Customers experienced no difference in the level of service during the test and were not separated from the system at any time.The microgrid will ultimately connect with an existing microgrid on the campus of Illinois Tech, resulting in one of the most advanced urban microgrid clusters in the nation. Donnelly said, \"The microgrid cluster creates a unique opportunity to study how to maximize the value of the interaction between two microgrids in the ongoing effort to enhance grid resiliency and security.\"ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC), a Fortune 100 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers - the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state's population.
