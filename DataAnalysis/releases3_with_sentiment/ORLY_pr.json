highlighted by a 4.4% increase in comparable store sales and a 14.2% increase in diluted earnings per share.\u00a0 While our comparable store sales results for the fourth quarter were in the top half of our expected range, we continued to see ongoing inflationary pressures in our expense structure, and primarily due to an unexpected surge in health benefit costs, our operating profit for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations.\u201dSales for the fourth quarter ended December\u00a031,\u00a02019, increased $168 million, or 7%, to $2.48 billion from $2.31 billion for the same

ago.\u00a0 Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 3% to $442 million (or 17.8% of sales) from $428 million (or 18.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago.Net income for the fourth

common share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $4.25 on 76 million shares versus $3.72 on 81 million shares for the same period one year ago.Full-Year Financial ResultsMr. Johnson continued, \u201cTeam O\u2019Reilly\u2019s commitment to providing the highest level of customer service in the industry, along with our relentless focus on profitable growth, resulted in full-year comparable stores sales growth of 4.0%, a 5.8% increase in full-year operating profit and an 11.1% increase in 2019 diluted earnings per share.\u00a0 I would like to take this opportunity to\u00a0thank our Team

December\u00a031,\u00a02019, increased 6% to $1.92 billion (or 18.9% of sales) from $1.82 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago.Net income for the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02019, increased $67 million, or 5%, to $1.39 billion (or 13.7% of sales) from $1.32 billion (or 13.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago.\u00a0 Diluted earnings per

\u201cWe successfully met our goal of 200 net, new store openings in 2019, in addition to converting 20 acquired Bennett stores to the O\u2019Reilly brand.\u00a0 Also, we closed on our acquisition of Mayasa Auto Parts on November 29, 2019, and we are very pleased to officially welcome the over 1,100 Mayasa Team Members into the O\u2019Reilly family.\u00a0 The Mayasa acquisition represents

as we enter the Mexican automotive aftermarket.\u00a0 We continued to enhance our industry-leading distribution network in 2019, as we successfully opened our 28th distribution center in Twinsburg, Ohio, and have two additional distribution center projects under construction in the Nashville and Memphis markets, which will both open in 2020.\u00a0\u201d4th Quarter and Full-Year Comparable Store

additional $1.0 billion authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on February\u00a05, 2020.\u00a0 Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time, as the Company deems appropriate, solely through open market repurchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate requirements and overall

        "content": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Oct.  23, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- O\u2019Reilly Automotive, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cO\u2019Reilly\u201d) (Nasdaq: ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, today announced record revenues and earnings for its third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2019.3rd Quarter Financial ResultsGreg Johnson, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s CEO and Co-President, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter, highlighted by comparable store sales growth of 5.0%, which was at the high end of our guidance and on top of our solid 3.9% comparable store sales growth in the prior year. Our Team is committed to driving profitable growth, and we are pleased with our ability to deliver strong sales growth in the quarter, while also expanding our gross margin by 35 basis points. We capitalized on the top-line results, as our team diligently controlled expenses to leverage SG&A by 22 basis points over last year, resulting in a total increase in operating profit dollars of 11%. Our third quarter performance and ongoing success is the direct result of our Team Members\u2019 continued hard work and dedication, and I would like to thank each of them for their relentless commitment to providing the highest levels of service in the industry.\u201dSales for the third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2019, increased $184 million, or 7%, to $2.67 billion from $2.48 billion for the same period one year ago. Gross profit for the third quarter increased 8% to $1.42 billion (or 53.3% of sales) from $1.32 billion (or 53.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) for the third quarter increased 7% to $886 million (or 33.2% of sales) from $831 million (or 33.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Operating income for the third quarter increased 11% to $536 million (or 20.1% of sales) from $485 million (or 19.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago.Net income for the third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2019, increased $25 million to $391 million (or 14.7% of sales) from $366 million (or 14.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter increased 13% to $5.08 on 77 million shares versus $4.50 on 81 million shares for the same period one year ago.Year-to-Date Financial ResultsMr. Johnson continued, \u201cThrough the first nine months of 2019, our free cash flow results were stronger than planned, primarily driven by the amount and timing of our quarterly estimated tax payments. We continue to invest in renewable energy projects that generate investment tax credits and the timing of these investments can create unevenness in our cash flows, however, we expect this timing to normalize during the fourth quarter, and for the full-year, we continue to expect free cash flow to finish in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion.\u201dSales for the first nine months of 2019 increased $446 million, or 6%, to $7.67 billion from $7.22 billion for the same period one year ago. Gross profit for the first nine months of 2019 increased 7% to $4.07 billion (or 53.1% of sales) from $3.81 billion (or 52.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago. SG&A for the first nine months of 2019 increased 7% to $2.59 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.42 billion (or 33.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Operating income for the first nine months of 2019 increased 7% to $1.48 billion (or 19.3% of sales) from $1.39 billion (or 19.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.Net income for the first nine months of 2019 increased $42 million, or 4%, to $1.07 billion (or 13.9% of sales) from $1.02 billion (or 14.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the first nine months of 2019 increased 10% to $13.63 on 78 million shares versus $12.36 on 83 million shares for the same period one year ago.Mr. Johnson concluded, \u201cAs we discussed in our second quarter earnings release, year-to-date store openings through June 30 fell short of our plan, due to weather related construction delays. We made significant progress with store openings during the third quarter to close that timing gap, and remain on track to open 200 net, new stores by the end of 2019. We continue to view organic store growth to be a strong opportunity to invest capital at robust rates of return and plan to continue to execute our expansion strategy during 2020 with the addition of approximately 180 net, new stores. This target is slightly below our 2019 store opening pace as our Teams will be heavily involved with completing the acquisition of Mayasa Auto Parts, which we announced in August. We are very excited to close on this acquisition in the fourth quarter and begin the process of partnering with the experienced Mayasa leadership team to capitalize on the long-term profitable growth opportunities that exist in the Mexican market.\u201d3rd Quarter Comparable Store Sales ResultsComparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation. Comparable store sales increased 5.0% for the third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2019, on top of 3.9% for the same period one year ago. Comparable store sales increased 3.9% for the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2019, on top of 4.0% for the same period one year ago.Share Repurchase ProgramDuring the third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $377.85, for a total investment of $387 million.
