        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Feb 13, 2020 7:01AM EST",
        "content": "    PITTSBURGH & CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nThe Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC) (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results.\n\n\u201cWhile our 2019 results were disappointing, we closed the year with performance consistent with our expectations, and driven by factors we anticipated,\u201d said Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio. \"We have taken critical actions over the past six months to re-establish visibility and control over the business. And we remain convinced Kraft Heinz has the potential to achieve best-in-class financial performance as we begin transforming our capabilities and making necessary investments in our brands based on deep consumer insights. Our turnaround will take time, but we expect to make significant progress in 2020, laying a strong foundation for future growth.\u201d\n\nQ4 2019 Financial Summary\n\nNet sales were $6.5 billion, down 5.1 percent versus the year-ago period, including a negative 2.3 percentage point impact from divestitures and an unfavorable 0.6 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales(1) decreased 2.2 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 2.0 percentage points versus the prior year period, with higher pricing in all business segments except Canada. Volume/mix decreased 4.2 percentage points, primarily driven by volume/mix declines in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Rest of World markets that more than offset growth in Canada and EMEA.\n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders increased to $182 million and diluted EPS increased to $0.15, primarily reflecting lower non-cash impairment charges recognized in the current year period. The current period included approximately $453 million of non-cash impairment charges to lower the carrying amount of goodwill in the Company\u2019s Australia & New Zealand, as well as Latin America Exports businesses, as well as non-cash impairment charges of approximately $213 million to lower the carrying amount of the Maxwell House trademark. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.6 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.6 billion, including an unfavorable 1.3 percentage point impact from currency and a negative 1.5 percentage point impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, growth in the United States and EMEA was more than offset by higher supply chain costs in Rest of World markets, higher general corporate expenses, and lower pricing versus the prior year period in Canada. Adjusted EPS decreased 14.3 percent to $0.72, reflecting lower Adjusted EBITDA, a higher effective tax rate, and higher stock-based compensation versus the prior year period.\n\nQ4 2019 Business Segment Highlights\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States net sales were $4.7 billion, down 2.7 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 3.1 percentage points, reflecting a combination of higher list prices in several categories, including price increases to reflect higher key commodity(2) costs for dairy and meats, as well as a favorable impact from promotional timing versus the prior year, and reduced promotional intensity compared to the year-ago period. Volume/mix decreased 5.8 percentage points, primarily due to lower shipments of cheese, coffee, cold cuts, and bacon that more than offset growth in condiments and sauces as well as foodservice. The decreases reflect volume declines in response to higher prices, including prior year promotional activities that were not repeated, as well as lower distribution in cold cuts and frozen categories at select retailers.\n\nUnited States Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.3 billion, driven by higher pricing, lower procurement and logistics costs, as well as lower variable compensation versus the prior year. This more than offset unfavorable impacts from volume/mix and key commodity cost inflation, specifically in dairy and meats, as well as higher manufacturing costs.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada net sales were $457 million, 23.8 percent lower than the year-ago period, including a negative 21.4 percentage point impact from the Canadian natural cheese divestiture and a favorable 0.1 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales decreased 2.5 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing declined 5.0 percentage points, reflecting unfavorable trade expense versus the prior year and increased holiday-related promotional activity across several categories. Volume/mix increased 2.5 percent, driven by consumption-led growth in peanut butter and pasta sauce that more than offset lower shipments for cheese and ongoing weakness in coffee.\n\nCanada Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 26.1 percent versus the year-ago period to $116 million, including a negative 14.8 percentage point impact from a divestiture and a 0.2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. Excluding the impact of these factors, the decrease versus prior year was due to lower pricing, as well as unfavorable dairy and procurement costs versus the prior year period.\n\nEMEA\n\nEMEA net sales were $689 million, down 0.5 percent versus the year-ago period, due to a negative 0.8 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 0.3 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing was slightly favorable as gains from pricing initiatives, particularly in the UK, more than offset lower pricing versus the prior year in Russia. Volume/mix increased 0.2 percentage points, reflecting condiments and sauces growth in Russia, as well as foodservice growth across most regions that more than offset ongoing weakness in infant nutrition and the impact of reduced promotional activity versus the year-ago period in the UK.\n\nEMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.3 percent versus the year-ago period to $182 million, despite a negative 1.4 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.7 percent, from a combination of Organic Net Sales growth and lower variable compensation versus the prior year period.\n\nRest of World(3)\n\nRest of World net sales of $708 million decreased 10.1 percent versus the year-ago period, including a negative 5.2 percentage point impact from currency and a negative 3.3 percentage point impact from the India nutritional beverages divestiture. Organic Net Sales decreased 1.6 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 0.7 percentage points, due to higher pricing in Latin America and China that more than offset lower pricing in Australia. Volume/mix decreased 2.3 percentage points, as growth in Indonesia and Brazil was more than offset by lower shipments across several categories in Australia and New Zealand as well as lower shipments in Latin American exports, including Colombia and Puerto Rico.\n\nRest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 53.9 percent versus the year-ago period to $60 million, including an 8.0 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency and a 0.3 percentage point unfavorable impact from divestiture. Results also included approximately $35 million of costs not expected to repeat, due to $15 million of higher labor-related expenses associated with the Holidays Act in New Zealand as well as $20 million of asset- and inventory-related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Excluding these factors, the decline in Segment Adjusted EBITDA was driven by ongoing supply chain cost inflation and lower volume/mix.\n\nEnd Notes\n\nWebcast, Conference Call, and Filing Information\n\nA webcast of The Kraft Heinz Company's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call will be available at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com.

For additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's forward-looking statements, see the Company's risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in its filings with the SEC. The Company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) that are presented in this press release.\n\nTo supplement the financial information, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting the Company's non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\n\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA and Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA are tools that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\n\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, and U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit), and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.\n\nSee the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures for the relevant periods.\n\n\u00a0\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200213005226/en/\nMichael Mullen (media)\nMichael.Mullen@kraftheinz.com \n\nChristopher Jakubik, CFA (investors)\nir@kraftheinz.com\nSource: The Kraft Heinz Company",

        "content": "\nWith so many situations shown in just 30 seconds, HEINZ guarantees fans will want to watch the ad multiple times.\n    PITTSBURGH & CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nToday HEINZ revealed its full commercial for the big game, directed by Roman Coppola, which will bring to life four ads at once in a four-quadrant split-screen format. With so much happening in just 30 seconds, HEINZ guarantees fans will want to watch the ad again and again and again. The ad will run during the second quarter, fourth commercial break of the big game on FOX.\n\nIn the commercial, four distinct, nerve-racking situations play out simultaneously to show how in so many situations, the familiarity of HEINZ can offer a little reassurance. The ad storylines include navigating an unfamiliar market (on another planet), stopping at a lonely diner (complete with a solo clown), meeting a significant other\u2019s parents (who are evil super villains), and moving into a new (seemingly haunted) house. All scenarios are instantly made better by the reassuring presence of a HEINZ Ketchup bottle.\n\n\u201cFor Americans everywhere, HEINZ is that staple you can always count on. No matter where you are, when you spot that iconic bottle, it has the power to make so many situations just a little bit better,\u201d said Dalia Adler, brand building lead, HEINZ. \u201cThe big game felt like the perfect time to remind the world that HEINZ will always be there to add some goodness.\u201d\n\nFor over 150 years, HEINZ has been there to add \u201cgoodness\u201d to moments big and small, and is using the big game to kick off its new \u201cFind the Goodness\u201d campaign developed in partnership with advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy New York.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is all about those little moments of reassurance that remind you things are going to be okay,\u201d said Laddie Peterson, creative director at Wieden+Kennedy New York. \u201cThat\u2019s what HEINZ brings to any situation \u2014 the goodness. What fans will see in this spot and throughout the Find the Goodness campaign is some of those moments when HEINZ made something better. And since there were too many to choose from, we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s never been done before in the big game: airing four spots at once. With Roman\u2019s precision, attention to detail and cinematic eye, he was a great creative partner to pull this challenge off. We\u2019re excited to give fans a peek into this one before the big game.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think of a way that four stories can share resemblance, be on the screen together, be cohesive and visually attractive, and be inviting for the viewer to watch, was a fun challenge that gave a very interesting set of parameters to work within,\u201d said Roman Coppola, the director of the HEINZ ad. \u201cWe tried to be creative and also strict about the form, to make the ad best suited for people to see four things at once.\u201d\n\nWatch HEINZ\u2019s big game spot by visiting HEINZ on YouTube or following HEINZ on Twitter, and stay tuned for more goodness from HEINZ in 2020.\n\nAbout The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nFor 150 years, we have produced some of the world\u2019s most beloved products at The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC).

        "content": "    SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nZippin, the industry leading startup enabling cashierless checkout for brick and mortar retail, announced the recent closing of $12 million in Series A funding led by Evolv Ventures, the venture fund backed by Kraft Heinz.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191212005444/en/Zippin cashierless checkout. (Photo: Business Wire)\nZippin uses a combination of computer vision, AI, and sensor fusion technology to offer consumers a completely checkout-free shopping experience. Launched in 2015, the company is powering four autonomous public stores and several private pilot stores globally. Zippin most recently made headlines for its newly operational autonomous concession stand in Golden 1 Center, home of the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Series A round was led by Evolv Ventures, which is focused on making investments in emerging and fast-growing technology-enabled companies transforming the food and CPG industry. Other investors in the round include SAP.iO, Scrum Ventures, major Latin American distributor Arca Continental, and Nomura Research Institute and NTT DOCOMO Ventures from Japan. Existing investors Maven Ventures, Core Ventures Group, Pear Ventures and Montage Ventures also participated in the over-subscribed round.\n\nThe Series A funding will help Zippin accelerate new store launches in the coming months, with plans to open new stores for grocery and convenience chains, sports facilities, airports and more. The Sacramento Kings\u2019 venue also marks the launch of the \u2018Zippin Cube\u2019, a unique modular, pre-fabricated \u2018store-in-a-box\u2019 concept that allows retailers to launch a fully functional autonomous microstore (300 \u2013 500 sq. ft) in less than three weeks from placing the order.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the Zippin platform for retailers in 2018, we removed friction from the checkout process. With the Zippin Cube, we are aiming to remove friction from bringing that experience to retail stores,\u201d said Krishna Motukuri, CEO of Zippin. \u201cWe obsess about retail operations and physical infrastructure just as much as we obsess about AI and computer vision. That\u2019s why we have more operational public stores than most other startups in the checkout-free space.\u201d\n\nFor leading global CPG companies like Kraft Heinz, the emergence of this new retail paradigm presents an opportunity to get closer to the end consumer, provide a superior shopping experience, and build a better, data-driven understanding of shopper behaviors and preferences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to join Zippin\u2019s journey as these new formats become critical to the transition currently underway in retail,\u201d said Smriti Jayaraman, Principal at Evolv Ventures. \u201cZippin\u2019s technology also offers CPG brands, which have previously been at arm\u2019s length from the point of sale, a unique set of opportunities to participate in the customer journey.\u201d\n\nThis round brings the company\u2019s total funding to $15 million and will allow Zippin to further invest in product innovation, grow its technical team and expand sales and partnership efforts.\n\nTo learn more or launch a Zippin pilot, visit www.getzippin.com.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191212005444/en/\nMedia Contact:\nLynne Galia\nLynne.galia@kraftheinz.com\nSource: Kraft Heinz",

        "subtitle": "",
        "date": "Oct 31, 2019 7:35AM EDT",
        "content": "    PITTSBURGH & CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nThe Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC) (\u201cKraft Heinz\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today reported third quarter 2019 financial results that reflected a one-time gain on the sale of the Company's Canadian natural cheese business, lower net sales, and higher input costs.\n\n\u201cWhile our third-quarter results remain below our potential, we showed sequential improvement versus the first half, and I believe we are beginning to operate the business better,\u201d said Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio. \"We are making good progress in identifying and addressing the root causes of past performance, as well as setting our strategic direction. Although there is still much work ahead, we\u2019re encouraged by our improving performance, and are even more confident in our ability to turn around the Company and set a path of long term growth and profitability.\u201d\n\nQ3 2019 Financial Summary\n\nNet sales were $6.1 billion, down 4.8 percent versus the year-ago period, including a negative 2.0 percentage point impact from divestitures and an unfavorable 1.7 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales(1) decreased 1.1 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 1.0 percent versus the prior year period, reflecting higher pricing in the United States, Rest of World and EMEA segments that more than offset lower pricing in Canada. Volume/mix was 2.1 percentage points below the prior year period as global growth in condiments and sauces was more than offset by lower shipments in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders increased to $899 million and diluted EPS increased to $0.74, primarily reflecting the gain on the sale of Canadian natural cheese business and a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year period that was partially offset by debt extinguishment costs associated with the tender offers. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.8 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.5 billion, including 3.2 percentage point impact from unfavorable currency and a negative 1.4 percentage point impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the decrease was driven by declines in the United States and Canada, as well as higher general corporate expenses that more than offset growth in EMEA. Adjusted EPS decreased 9.2% percent to $0.69, reflecting lower Adjusted EBITDA, higher taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period, and lower interest expense versus the year-ago period.\n\nQ3 2019 Business Segment Highlights\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States net sales were $4.4 billion, down 1.6 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 1.5 percentage points, driven by price increases across several categories, including Oscar Mayer cold cuts, Philadelphia cream cheese, macaroni & cheese, and Lunchables. This more than offset pricing to offset lower key commodity(2) costs in coffee and nuts. Volume/mix decreased 3.1 percentage points, primarily driven by lower retail takeaway in natural cheese, cold cuts and Lunchables, as well as unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year period. This more than offset consumption-led growth in condiments and sauces, and, to a lesser extent, nuts.\n\nUnited States Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.8 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.2 billion, driven by unfavorable volume/mix that more than offset higher pricing and favorable timing of marketing expenses versus the prior year period.\n\nCanada\n\nCanada net sales were $415 million, 21.1 percent lower than the year-ago period, including a negative 19.8 percentage point impact from the Canadian natural cheese divestiture and a 0.8 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Organic Net Sales decreased 0.5 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing declined 2.6 percentage points, driven by increased promotional activity and unfavorable trade expense in cheese that more than offset higher pricing of macaroni and cheese. Volume/mix increased 2.1 percent, reflecting growth from increased promotional support in cheese and pasta sauce, as well as a partial recovery of retail inventory levels in certain categories. These gains more than offset a decline in macaroni and cheese due to reduced promotional activity and lower coffee shipments versus the prior year period.\n\nCanada Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 25.7 percent versus the year-ago period to $107 million, including a 14.9 percentage point impact from a divestiture and a 0.8 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Excluding the impact of these factors, the decrease versus the prior year was driven by lower pricing and higher input costs.\n\nEMEA\n\nEMEA net sales were $612 million, down 3.5 percent versus the year-ago period, due to a negative 3.9 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 0.4 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing was up 0.2 percentage points, with higher pricing in the UK more than offsetting lower pricing in other regions. Volume/mix increased 0.2 percentage points, driven by favorable shipment timing versus the prior year period in Russia and foodservice growth across most regions that more than offset ongoing weakness in infant nutrition.\n\nEMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.3 percent versus the year-ago period to $165 million, despite a negative 4.4 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.7 percent, primarily reflecting lower supply chain costs.\n\nRest of World(3)\n\nRest of World net sales of $688 million decreased 13.3 percent versus the year-ago period, including a negative 10.2 percentage point impact from currency and a 3.3 percentage point negative impact from the India nutritional beverages divestiture. Organic Net Sales increased 0.2 percent versus the year-ago period, driven by a 0.9 percentage point increase from pricing. Price increases in Latin America, including in highly inflationary markets, more than offset lower pricing in Asia Pacific. Volume/mix decreased 0.7 percentage points, as ongoing weakness in China infant nutritional products more than offset growth from condiments and sauces, foodservice, and Indonesia beverages.\n\nRest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 32.7 percent versus the year-ago period to $100 million, due to a negative 31.1 percentage point impact from currency, as well as higher supply chain costs and lower Organic Net Sales in Asia Pacific.\n\nEnd Notes\n\nWebcast, Conference Call, and Filing Information\n\nA webcast of The Kraft Heinz Company's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call will be available at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com.

For additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's forward-looking statements, see the Company's risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in its filings with the SEC. The Company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) that are presented in this press release.\n\nTo supplement the financial information, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting the Company's non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\n\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA and Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA are tools that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\n\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, and U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit), and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.\n\nSee the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures for the relevant periods.\n\n\u00a0\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191031005469/en/\nMichael Mullen (media)\nMichael.Mullen@kraftheinz.com\n\nChristopher Jakubik, CFA (investors)\nir@kraftheinz.com\nSource: The Kraft Heinz Company",
